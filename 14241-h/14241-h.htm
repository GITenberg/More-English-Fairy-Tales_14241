    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <br />

    <p>This volume will come, I fancy, as a surprise both to my brother
    folk-lorists and to the public in general. It might naturally have
    been thought that my former volume (<i>English Fairy Tales</i>) had
    almost exhausted the scanty remains of the traditional folk-tales of
    England. Yet I shall be much disappointed if the present collection is
    not found to surpass the former in interest and vivacity, while for
    the most part it goes over hitherto untrodden ground, the majority of
    the tales in this book have either never appeared before, or have
    never been brought between the same boards.</p>
    <p>In putting these tales together, I have acted on the same
    principles as in the preceding volume, which has already, I am happy
    to say, established itself as a kind of English Grimm. I have taken
    English tales wherever I could find them, one from the United States,
    some from the Lowland Scotch, and a few have been adapted from
    ballads, while I have left a couple in their original metrical form. I
    have rewritten most of them, and in doing so have adopted the
    traditional English style of folk-telling, with its "Wells" and
    "Lawkamercy" and archaic touches, which are known nowadays as
    vulgarisms. From former experience, I find that each of these
    principles has met with some dissent from critics who have written
    from the high and lofty standpoint of folk-lore, or from the lowlier
    vantage of "mere literature." I take this occasion to soften their
    ire, or perhaps give them further cause for reviling.</p>
    <p>My folk-lore friends look on with sadness while they view me laying
    profane hands on the sacred text of my originals. I have actually at
    times introduced or deleted whole incidents, have given another turn
    to a tale, or finished off one that was incomplete, while I have had
    no scruple in prosing a ballad or softening down over-abundant
    dialect. This is rank sacrilege in the eyes of the rigid orthodox in
    matters folk-lorical. My defence might be that I had a cause at heart
    as sacred as our science of folk-lore&mdash;the filling of our
    children's imaginations with bright trains of images. But even on the
    lofty heights of folk-lore science I am not entirely defenceless. Do
    my friendly critics believe that even Campbell's materials had not
    been modified by the various narrators before they reached the great
    J.F.? Why may I not have the same privilege as any other story-teller,
    especially when I know the ways of story-telling as she is told in
    English, at least as well as a Devonshire or Lancashire peasant?
    And&mdash;conclusive argument&mdash;wilt thou, oh orthodox brother
    folk-lorist, still continue to use Grimm and Asbj&ouml;rnsen? Well,
    they did the same as I.</p>
    <p>Then as to using tales in Lowland Scotch, whereat a Saturday
    Reviewer, whose identity and fatherland were not difficult to guess,
    was so shocked. Scots a dialect of English! Scots tales the same as
    English! Horror and Philistinism! was the Reviewer's outcry. Matter of
    fact is my reply, which will only confirm him, I fear, in his
    convictions. Yet I appeal to him, why make a difference between tales
    told on different sides of the Border? A tale told in Durham or
    Cumberland in a dialect which only Dr. Murray could distinguish from
    Lowland Scotch, would on all hands be allowed to be "English." The
    same tale told a few miles farther North, why should we refuse it the
    same qualification? A tale in Henderson is English: why not a tale in
    Chambers, the majority of whose tales are to be found also south of
    the Tweed?</p>
    <p>The truth is, my folk-lore friends and my Saturday Reviewer differ
    with me on the important problem of the origin of folk-tales. They
    think that a tale probably originated where it was found. They
    therefore attribute more importance than I to the exact form in which
    it is found and restrict it to the locality of birth. I consider the
    probability to lie in an origin elsewhere: I think it more likely than
    not that any tale found in a place was rather brought there than born
    there. I have discussed this matter elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_1_1"
    name='FNanchor_1_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1_1'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
    with all the solemnity its importance deserves, and cannot attempt
    further to defend my position here. But even the reader innocent of
    folk-lore can see that, holding these views, I do not attribute much
    anthropological value to tales whose origin is probably foreign, and
    am certainly not likely to make a hard-and-fast division between tales
    of the North Countrie and those told across the Border.</p>
    <p>As to how English folk-tales should be told authorities also
    differ. I am inclined to follow the tradition of my old nurse, who was
    not bred at Girton and who scorned at times the rules of Lindley
    Murray and the diction of smart society. I have been recommended to
    adopt a diction not too remote from that of the Authorised Version.
    Well, quite apart from memories of my old nurse, we have a certain
    number of tales actually taken down from the mouths of the people, and
    these are by no means in Authorised form; they even trench on the
    "vulgar"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the archaic. Now there is just a touch of
    snobbery in objecting to these archaisms and calling them "vulgar."
    These tales have been told, if not from time immemorial, at least for
    several generations, in a special form which includes dialect and
    "vulgar" words. Why desert that form for one which the children cannot
    so easily follow with "thous" and "werts" and all the artificialities
    of pseudo-Elizabethan? Children are not likely to say "darter" for
    "daughter," or to ejaculate "Lawkamercyme" because they come across
    these forms in their folk-tales. They recognise the unusual forms
    while enjoying the fun of them. I have accordingly retained the
    archaisms and the old-world formul&aelig; which go so well with the
    folk-tale.</p>
    <p>In compiling the present collection I have drawn on the store of
    140 tales with which I originally started; some of the best of these I
    reserved for this when making up the former one. That had necessarily
    to contain the old favourites <i>Jack the Giant Killer</i>, <i>Dick
    Whittington</i>, and the rest, which are often not so interesting or
    so well told as the less familiar ones buried in periodicals or
    folk-lore collections. But since the publication of <i>English Fairy
    Tales</i>, I have been specially fortunate in obtaining access to
    tales entirely new and exceptionally well told, which have been either
    published during the past three years or have been kindly placed at my
    disposal by folk-lore friends. Among these, the tales reported by Mrs.
    Balfour, with a thorough knowledge of the peasants' mind and mode of
    speech, are a veritable acquisition. I only regret that I have had to
    tone down so much of dialect in her versions. She has added to my
    indebtedness to her by sending me several tales which are entirely new
    and inedited. Mrs. Gomme comes only second in rank among my creditors
    for thanks which I can scarcely pay without becoming bankrupt in
    gratitude. Other friends have been equally kind, especially Mr. Alfred
    Nutt, who has helped by adapting some of the book versions, and by
    reading the proofs, while to the Councils of the American and English
    Folk-Lore Societies I have again to repeat my thanks for permission to
    use materials which first appeared in their publications. Finally, I
    have had Mr. Batten with me once again&mdash;what should I or other
    English children do without him?</p>

    <p>Newtown, or Franchville, as 't was called of old, is a sleepy
    little town, as you all may know, upon the Solent shore. Sleepy as it
    is now, it was once noisy enough, and what made the noise
    was&mdash;rats. The place was so infested with them as to be scarce
    worth living in. There wasn't a barn or a corn-rick, a store-room or a
    cupboard, but they ate their way into it. Not a cheese but they gnawed
    it hollow, not a sugar puncheon but they cleared out. Why the very
    mead and beer in the barrels was not safe from them. They'd gnaw a
    hole in the top of the tun, and down would go one master rat's tail,
    and when he brought it up round would crowd all the friends and
    cousins, and each would have a suck at the tail.</p>
    <p>Had they stopped here it might have been borne. But the squeaking
    and shrieking, the hurrying and scurrying, so that you could neither
    hear yourself speak nor get a wink of good honest sleep the live-long
    night! Not to mention that, Mamma must needs sit up, and keep watch
    and ward over baby's cradle, or there'd have been a big ugly rat
    running across the poor little fellow's face, and doing who knows what
    mischief.</p>
    <p>Why didn't the good people of the town have cats? Well they did,
    and there was a fair stand-up fight, but in the end the rats were too
    many, and the pussies were regularly driven from the field. Poison, I
    hear you say? Why, they poisoned so many that it fairly bred a plague.
    Ratcatchers! Why there wasn't a ratcatcher from John o' Groat's house
    to the Land's End that hadn't tried his luck. But do what they might,
    cats or poison, terrier or traps, there seemed to be more rats than
    ever, and every day a fresh rat was cocking his tail or pricking his
    whiskers.</p>
    <p>The Mayor and the town council were at their wits' end. As they
    were sitting one day in the town hall racking their poor brains, and
    bewailing their hard fate, who should run in but the town beadle.
    "Please your Honour," says he, "here is a very queer fellow come to
    town. I don't rightly know what to make of him." "Show him in," said
    the Mayor, and in he stepped. A queer fellow, truly. For there wasn't
    a colour of the rainbow but you might find it in some corner of his
    dress, and he was tall and thin, and had keen piercing eyes.</p>
    <p>"I'm called the Pied Piper," he began. "And pray what might you be
    willing to pay me, if I rid you of every single rat in
    Franchville?"</p>
    <p>Well, much as they feared the rats, they feared parting with their
    money more, and fain would they have higgled and haggled. But the
    Piper was not a man to stand nonsense, and the upshot was that fifty
    pounds were promised him (and it meant a lot of money in those old
    days) as soon as not a rat was left to squeak or scurry in
    Franchville.</p>
    <p>Out of the hall stepped the Piper, and as he stepped he laid his
    pipe to his lips and a shrill keen tune sounded through street and
    house. And as each note pierced the air you might have seen a strange
    sight. For out of every hole the rats came tumbling. There were none
    too old and none too young, none too big and none too little to crowd
    at the Piper's heels and with eager feet and upturned noses to patter
    after him as he paced the streets. Nor was the Piper unmindful of the
    little toddling ones, for every fifty yards he'd stop and give an
    extra flourish on his pipe just to give them time to keep up with the
    older and stronger of the band.</p>
    <p>Up Silver Street he went, and down Gold Street, and at the end of
    Gold Street is the harbour and the broad Solent beyond. And as he
    paced along, slowly and gravely, the townsfolk flocked to door and
    window, and many a blessing they called down upon his head.</p>
    <p>As for getting near him there were too many rats. And now that he
    was at the water's edge he stepped into a boat, and not a rat, as he
    shoved off into deep water, piping shrilly all the while, but followed
    him, plashing, paddling, and wagging their tails with delight. On and
    on he played and played until the tide went down, and each master rat
    sank deeper and deeper in the slimy ooze of the harbour, until every
    mother's son of them was dead and smothered.</p>

      alt='"...as he shoved off into deep water, piping shrilly all the while..."' />
      </a>
    </center>
    <p>The tide rose again, and the Piper stepped on shore, but never a
    rat followed. You may fancy the townsfolk had been throwing up their
    caps and hurrahing and stopping up rat holes and setting the church
    bells a-ringing. But when the Piper stepped ashore and not so much as
    a single squeak was to be heard, the Mayor and the Council, and the
    townsfolk generally, began to hum and to ha and to shake their
    heads.</p>
    <p>For the town money chest had been sadly emptied of late, and where
    was the fifty pounds to come from? Such an easy job, too! Just getting
    into a boat and playing a pipe! Why the Mayor himself could have done
    that if only he had thought of it.</p>
    <p>So he hummed and ha'ad and at last, "Come, my good man," said he,
    "you see what poor folk we are; how can we manage to pay you fifty
    pounds? Will you not take twenty? When all is said and done, 't will
    be good pay for the trouble you've taken."</p>
    <p>"Fifty pounds was what I bargained for," said the piper shortly;
    "and if I were you I'd pay it quickly. For I can pipe many kinds of
    tunes, as folk sometimes find to their cost."</p>
    <p>"Would you threaten us, you strolling vagabond?" shrieked the
    Mayor, and at the same time he winked to the Council; "the rats are
    all dead and drowned," muttered he; and so "You may do your worst, my
    good man," and with that he turned short upon his heel.</p>
    <p>"Very well," said the Piper, and he smiled a quiet smile. With that
    he laid his pipe to his lips afresh, but now there came forth no
    shrill notes, as it were, of scraping and gnawing, and squeaking and
    scurrying, but the tune was joyous and resonant, full of happy
    laughter and merry play. And as he paced down the streets the elders
    mocked, but from school-room and play-room, from nursery and workshop,
    not a child but ran out with eager glee and shout following gaily at
    the Piper's call. Dancing, laughing, joining hands and tripping feet,
    the bright throng moved along up Gold Street and down Silver Street,
    and beyond Silver Street lay the cool green forest full of old oaks
    and wide-spreading beeches. In and out among the oak-trees you might
    catch glimpses of the Piper's many-coloured coat. You might hear the
    laughter of the children break and fade and die away as deeper and
    deeper into the lone green wood the stranger went and the children
    followed.</p>
    <p>All the while, the elders watched and waited. They mocked no longer
    now. And watch and wait as they might, never did they set their eyes
    again upon the Piper in his parti-coloured coat. Never were their
    hearts gladdened by the song and dance of the children issuing forth
    from amongst the ancient oaks of the forest.</p>

    <h2>Hereafterthis</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time there was a farmer called Jan, and he lived all
    alone by himself in a little farmhouse.</p>
    <p>By-and-by he thought that he would like to have a wife to keep it
    all vitty for him.</p>
    <p>So he went a-courting a fine maid, and he said to her: "Will you
    marry me?"</p>
    <p>"That I will, to be sure," said she.</p>
    <p>So they went to church, and were wed. After the wedding was over,
    she got up on his horse behind him, and he brought her home. And they
    lived as happy as the day was long.</p>
    <p>One day, Jan said to his wife, "Wife can you milk-y?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, Jan, I can milk-y. Mother used to milk-y, when I lived
    home."</p>
    <p>So he went to market and bought her ten red cows. All went well
    till one day when she had driven them to the pond to drink, she
    thought they did not drink fast enough. So she drove them right into
    the pond to make them drink faster, and they were all drowned.</p>
    <p>When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he
    said, "Oh, well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next
    time."</p>
    <p>So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, Jan said to his wife,
    "Wife can you serve pigs?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, Jan, I can serve pigs. Mother used to serve pigs when I
    lived home."</p>
    <p>So Jan went to market and bought her some pigs. All went well till
    one day, when she had put their food into the trough she thought they
    did not eat fast enough, and she pushed their heads into the trough to
    make them eat faster, and they were all choked.</p>
    <p>When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he
    said, "Oh, well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next
    time."</p>
    <p>So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, Jan said to his wife,
    "Wife can you bake-y?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, Jan, I can bake-y. Mother used to bake-y when I lived
    home."</p>
    <p>So he bought everything for his wife so that she could bake bread.
    All went well for a bit, till one day, she thought she would bake
    white bread for a treat for Jan. So she carried her meal to the top of
    a high hill, and let the wind blow on it, for she thought to herself
    that the wind would blow out all the bran. But the wind blew away meal
    and bran and all&mdash;so there was an end of it.</p>
    <p>When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he
    said, "Oh, well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next
    time."</p>
    <p>So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, Jan said to his wife,
    "Wife can you brew-y?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, Jan, I can brew-y. Mother used to brew-y when I lived
    home."</p>
    <p>So he bought everything proper for his wife to brew ale with. All
    went well for a bit, till one day when she had brewed her ale and put
    it in the barrel, a big black dog came in and looked up in her face.
    She drove him out of the house, but he stayed outside the door and
    still looked up in her face. And she got so angry that she pulled out
    the plug of the barrel, threw it at the dog, and said, "What dost look
    at me for? I be Jan's wife." Then the dog ran down the road, and she
    ran after him to chase him right away. When she came back again, she
    found that the ale had all run out of the barrel, and so there was an
    end of it.</p>
    <p>When Jan came home, she up and told him what she had done, and he
    said, "Oh well, there, never mind, my dear, better luck next
    time."</p>
    <p>So they went on for a bit, and then, one day, she thought to
    herself, "'T is time to clean up my house." When she was taking down
    her big bed she found a bag of groats on the tester. So when Jan came
    home, she up and said to him, "Jan, what is that bag of groats on the
    tester for?"</p>
    <p>"That is for Hereafterthis, my dear."</p>
    <p>Now, there was a robber outside the window, and he heard what Jan
    said. Next day, he waited till Jan had gone to market, and then he
    came and knocked at the door. "What do you please to want?" said
    Mally.</p>
    <p>"I am Hereafterthis," said the robber, "I have come for the bag of
    groats."</p>
    <p>Now the robber was dressed like a fine gentleman, so she thought to
    herself it was very kind of so fine a man to come for the bag of
    groats, so she ran upstairs and fetched the bag of groats, and gave it
    to the robber and he went away with it.</p>
    <p>When Jan came home, she said to him, "Jan, Hereafterthis has been
    for the bag of groats."</p>
    <p>"What do you mean, wife?" said Jan.</p>
    <p>So she up and told him, and he said, "Then I'm a ruined man, for
    that money was to pay our rent with. The only thing we can do is to
    roam the world over till we find the bag of groats." Then Jan took the
    house-door off its hinges, "That's all we shall have to lie on," he
    said. So Jan put the door on his back, and they both set out to look
    for Hereafterthis. Many a long day they went, and in the night Jan
    used to put the door on the branches of a tree, and they would sleep
    on it. One night they came to a big hill, and there was a high tree at
    the foot. So Jan put the door up in it, and they got up in the tree
    and went to sleep. By-and-by Jan's wife heard a noise, and she looked
    to see what it was. It was an opening of a door in the side of the
    hill. Out came two gentlemen with a long table, and behind them fine
    ladies and gentlemen, each carrying a bag, and one of them was
    Hereafterthis with the bag of groats. They sat round the table, and
    began to drink and talk and count up all the money in the bags. So
    then Jan's wife woke him up, and asked what they should do.</p>
    <p>"Now's our time," said Jan, and he pushed the door off the
    branches, and it fell right in the very middle of the table, and
    frightened the robbers so that they all ran away. Then Jan and his
    wife got down from the tree, took as many money-bags as they could
    carry on the door, and went straight home. And Jan bought his wife
    more cows, and more pigs, and they lived happy ever after.</p>

    <h2>The Golden Ball</h2>
    <br />

    <p>There were two lasses, daughters of one mother, and as they came
    from the fair, they saw a right bonny young man stand at the
    house-door before them. They never saw such a bonny man before. He had
    gold on his cap, gold on his finger, gold on his neck, a red gold
    watch-chain&mdash;eh! but he had brass. He had a golden ball in each
    hand. He gave a ball to each lass, and she was to keep it, and if she
    lost it, she was to be hanged. One of the lasses, 't was the youngest,
    lost her ball. I'll tell thee how. She was by a park-paling, and she
    was tossing her ball, and it went up, and up, and up, till it went
    fair over the paling; and when she climbed up to look, the ball ran
    along the green grass, and it went right forward to the door of the
    house, and the ball went in and she saw it no more.</p>
    <p>So she was taken away to be hanged by the neck till she was dead
    because she'd lost her ball.</p>
    <p>But she had a sweetheart, and he said he would go and get the ball.
    So he went to the park-gate, but 't was shut; so he climbed the hedge,
    and when he got to the top of the hedge, an old woman rose up out of
    the dyke before him, and said, if he wanted to get the ball, he must
    sleep three nights in the house. He said he would.</p>
    <p>Then he went into the house, and looked for the ball, but could not
    find it. Night came on and he heard bogles move in the courtyard; so
    he looked out o' the window, and the yard was full of them.</p>
    <p>Presently he heard steps coming upstairs. He hid behind the door,
    and was as still as a mouse. Then in came a big giant five times as
    tall as he, and the giant looked round but did not see the lad, so he
    went to the window and bowed to look out; and as he bowed on his
    elbows to see the bogles in the yard, the lad stepped behind him, and
    with one blow of his sword he cut him in twain, so that the top part
    of him fell in the yard, and the bottom part stood looking out of the
    window.</p>
    <p>There was a great cry from the bogles when they saw half the giant
    come tumbling down to them, and they called out, "There comes half our
    master, give us the other half."</p>
    <p>So the lad said, "It's no use of thee, thou pair of legs, standing
    alone at the window, as thou hast no eye to see with, so go join thy
    brother;" and he cast the lower part of the giant after the top part.
    Now when the bogles had gotten all the giant they were quiet.</p>
    <p>Next night the lad was at the house again, and now a second giant
    came in at the door, and as he came in the lad cut him in twain, but
    the legs walked on to the chimney and went up them. "Go, get thee
    after thy legs," said the lad to the head, and he cast the head up the
    chimney too.</p>
    <p>The third night the lad got into bed, and he heard the bogles
    striving under the bed, and they had the ball there, and they were
    casting it to and fro.</p>
    <p>Now one of them has his leg thrust out from under the bed, so the
    lad brings his sword down and cuts it off. Then another thrusts his
    arm out at other side of the bed, and the lad cuts that off. So at
    last he had maimed them all, and they all went crying and wailing off,
    and forgot the ball, but he took it from under the bed, and went to
    seek his true-love.</p>
    <p>Now the lass was taken to York to be hanged; she was brought out on
    the scaffold, and the hangman said, "Now, lass, thou must hang by the
    neck till thou be'st dead." But she cried out:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Stop, stop, I think I see my mother
    coming!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>O mother, hast brought my golden
    ball</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>And come to set me
    free?"</span><br />
     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"I've neither brought thy golden
    ball</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Nor come to set thee
    free,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>But I have come to see thee
    hung</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Upon this
    gallows-tree."</span><br />

    <p>Then the hangman said, "Now, lass, say thy prayers for thou must
    die." But she said:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Stop, stop, I think I see my father
    coming!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>O father, hast brought my golden
    ball</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>And come to set me
    free?"</span><br />
     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"I've neither brought thy golden
    ball</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Nor come to set thee

    hung</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Upon this
    gallows-tree."</span><br />

    <p>Then the hangman said, "Hast thee done thy prayers? Now, lass, put
    thy head into the noose."</p>
    <p>But she answered, "Stop, stop, I think I see my brother coming!"
    And again she sang, and then she thought she saw her sister coming,
    then her uncle, then her aunt, then her cousin; but after this the
    hangman said, "I will stop no longer, thou 'rt making game of me. Thou
    must be hung at once."</p>
    <p>But now she saw her sweetheart coming through the crowd, and he
    held over his head in the air her own golden ball; so she said:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Stop, stop, I see my sweetheart
    coming!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Sweetheart, hast brought my golden
    ball</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>And come to set me

     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Aye, I have brought thy golden

     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>And come to set thee

    hung</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Upon this

    <p>And he took her home, and they lived happy ever after.</p>

    <h2>My Own Self</h2>
    <br />

    <p>In a tiny house in the North Countrie, far away from any town or
    village, there lived not long ago, a poor widow all alone with her
    little son, a six-year-old boy.</p>
    <p>The house-door opened straight on to the hill-side and all round
    about were moorlands and huge stones, and swampy hollows; never a
    house nor a sign of life wherever you might look, for their nearest
    neighbours were the "ferlies" in the glen below, and the
    "will-o'-the-wisps" in the long grass along the pathside.</p>
    <p>And many a tale she could tell of the "good folk" calling to each
    other in the oak-trees, and the twinkling lights hopping on to the
    very window sill, on dark nights; but in spite of the loneliness, she
    lived on from year to year in the little house, perhaps because she
    was never asked to pay any rent for it.</p>
    <p>But she did not care to sit up late, when the fire burnt low, and
    no one knew what might be about; so, when they had had their supper
    she would make up a good fire and go off to bed, so that if anything
    terrible <i>did</i> happen, she could always hide her head under the
    bed-clothes.</p>
    <p>This, however, was far too early to please her little son; so when
    she called him to bed, he would go on playing beside the fire, as if
    he did not hear her.</p>
    <p>He had always been bad to do with since the day he was born, and
    his mother did not often care to cross him; indeed, the more she tried
    to make him obey her, the less heed he paid to anything she said, so
    it usually ended by his taking his own way.</p>
    <p>But one night, just at the fore-end of winter, the widow could not
    make up her mind to go off to bed, and leave him playing by the
    fireside; for the wind was tugging at the door, and rattling the
    window-panes, and well she knew that on such a night, fairies and such
    like were bound to be out and about, and bent on mischief. So she
    tried to coax the boy into going at once to bed:</p>
    <p>"The safest bed to bide in, such a night as this!" she said: but
    no, he wouldn't.</p>
    <p>Then she threatened to "give him the stick," but it was no use.</p>
    <p>The more she begged and scolded, the more he shook his head; and
    when at last she lost patience and cried that the fairies would surely
    come and fetch him away, he only laughed and said he wished they
    <i>would</i>, for he would like one to play with.</p>
    <p>At that his mother burst into tears, and went off to bed in
    despair, certain that after such words something dreadful would
    happen; while her naughty little son sat on his stool by the fire, not
    at all put out by her crying.</p>
    <p>But he had not long been sitting there alone, when he heard a
    fluttering sound near him in the chimney and presently down by his
    side dropped the tiniest wee girl you could think of; she was not a
    span high, and had hair like spun silver, eyes as green as grass, and
    cheeks red as June roses. The little boy looked at her with
    surprise.</p>
    <img src='images/illus031.jpg' hspace='5' vspace='5' width='205'
    height='272' align='left'
    alt='"...the tiniest wee girl you could think of..."' border='0' />
    <p>"Oh!" said he; "what do they call ye?"</p>
    <p>"My own self," she said in a shrill but sweet little voice, and she
    looked at him too. "And what do they call ye?"</p>
    <p>"Just my own self too!" he answered cautiously; and with that they
    began to play together.</p>
    <p>She certainly showed him some fine games. She made animals out of
    the ashes that looked and moved like life; and trees with green leaves
    waving over tiny houses, with men and women an inch high in them, who,
    when she breathed on them, fell to walking and talking quite
    properly.</p>
    <p>But the fire was getting low, and the light dim, and presently the
    little boy stirred the coals with a stick to make them blaze; when out
    jumped a red-hot cinder, and where should it fall, but on the fairy
    child's tiny foot.</p>
    <p>Thereupon she set up such a squeal, that the boy dropped the stick,
    and clapped his hands to his ears but it grew to so shrill a screech,
    that it was like all the wind in the world whistling through one tiny
    keyhole.</p>
    <p>There was a sound in the chimney again, but this time the little
    boy did not wait to see what it was, but bolted off to bed, where he
    hid under the blankets and listened in fear and trembling to what went
    on.</p>
    <img src='images/illus032.jpg' hspace='5' vspace='5' width='250'
    height='262' align='right'
    alt='"...caught the creature by its ear..."' border='0' />
    <p>A voice came from the chimney speaking sharply:</p>
    <p>"Who's there, and what's wrong?" it said.</p>
    <p>"It's my own self," sobbed the fairy-child; "and my foot's burnt
    sore. O-o-h!"</p>
    <p>"Who did it?" said the voice angrily; this time it sounded nearer,
    and the boy, peeping from under the clothes, could see a white face
    looking out from the chimney-opening.</p>
    <p>"Just my own self too!" said the fairy-child again.</p>
    <p>"Then if ye did it your own self," cried the elf-mother shrilly,
    "what's the use o' making all this fash about it?"&mdash;and with that
    she stretched out a long thin arm, and caught the creature by its ear,
    and, shaking it roughly, pulled it after her, out of sight up the
    chimney.</p>
    <p>The little boy lay awake a long time, listening, in case the
    fairy-mother should come back after all; and next evening after
    supper, his mother was surprised to find that he was willing to go to
    bed whenever she liked.</p>
    <p>"He's taking a turn for the better at last!" she said to herself;
    but he was thinking just then that, when next a fairy came to play
    with him, he might not get off quite so easily as he had done this
    time.</p>

    <h2>Black Bull of Norroway</h2>
    <br />

    <p>In Norroway, long time ago, there lived a certain lady, and she had
    three daughters: The oldest of them said to her mother: "Mother, bake
    me a bannock, and roast me a collop, for I'm going away to seek my
    fortune." Her mother did so; and the daughter went away to an old
    witch washerwife and told her purpose. The old wife bade her stay that
    day, and look out of her back-door, and see what she could see. She
    saw nought the first day. The second day she did the same, and saw
    nought. On the third day she looked again, and saw a coach-and-six
    coming along the road. She ran in and told the old wife what she saw.
    "Well," quoth the old woman, "yon's for you." So they took her into
    the coach and galloped off.</p>
    <p>The second daughter next says to her mother: "Mother, bake me a
    bannock, and roast me a collop, for I'm going away to seek my
    fortune." Her mother did so; and away she went to the old wife, as her
    sister had done. On the third day she looked out of the back-door, and
    saw a coach-and-four coming along the road. "Well," quoth the old
    woman, "yon's for you." So they took her in, and off they set.</p>
    <p>The third daughter says to her mother: "Mother, bake me a bannock,
    and roast me a collop, for I'm going away to seek my fortune." Her
    mother did so; and away she went to the old witch. She bade her look
    out of her back-door, and see what she could see She did so; and when
    she came back, said she saw nought. The second day she did the same,
    and saw nought. The third day she looked again, and on coming back
    said to the old wife she saw nought but a great Black Bull coming
    crooning along the road. "Well," quoth the old witch, "yon's for you."
    On hearing this she was next to distracted with grief and terror; but
    she was lifted up and set on his back, and away they went.</p>
    <p>Aye they travelled, and on they travelled, till the lady grew faint
    with hunger. "Eat out of my right ear," says the Black Bull, "and
    drink out of my left ear, and set by your leaving." So she did as he
    said, and was wonderfully refreshed. And long they rode, and hard they
    rode, till they came in sight of a very big and bonny castle. "Yonder
    we must be this night," quoth the Bull; "for my elder brother lives
    yonder;" and presently they were at the place. They lifted her off his
    back, and took her in, and sent him away to a park for the night. In
    the morning, when they brought the Bull home, they took the lady into
    a fine shining parlour, and gave her a beautiful apple, telling her
    not to break it till she was in the greatest strait ever mortal was in
    the world, and that would bring her out of it. Again she was lifted on
    the Bull's back, and after she had ridden far, and farther than I can
    tell, they came in sight of a far bonnier castle, and far farther away
    than the last. Says the Bull to her: "Yonder we must be this night,
    for my second brother lives yonder;" and they were at the place
    directly. They lifted her down and took her in, and sent the Bull to
    the field for the night. In the morning they took the lady into a fine
    and rich room, and gave her the finest pear she had ever seen, bidding
    her not to break it till she was in the greatest strait ever mortal
    could be in, and that would get her out of it. Again she was lifted
    and set on his back, and away they went. And long they rode, and hard
    they rode, till they came in sight of the far biggest castle and far
    farthest off, they had yet seen. "We must be yonder to-night," says
    the Bull, "for my young brother lives yonder;" and they were there
    directly. They lifted her down, took her in, and sent the Bull to the
    field for the night. In the morning they took her into a room, the
    finest of all, and gave her a plum, telling her not to break it till
    she was in the greatest strait mortal could be in, and that would get
    her out of it. Presently they brought home the Bull, set the lady on
    his back, and away they went.</p>
    <p>And aye they rode, and on they rode, till they came to a dark and
    ugsome glen, where they stopped, and the lady lighted down. Says the
    Bull to her: "Here you must stay till I go and fight the Old One. You
    must seat yourself on that stone, and move neither hand nor foot till
    I come back, else I'll never find you again. And if everything round
    about you turns blue, I have beaten the Old One; but should all things
    turn red, he'll have conquered me." She set herself down on the stone,
    and by-and-by all round her turned blue. Overcome with joy, she lifted
    one of her feet, and crossed it over the other, so glad was she that
    her companion was victorious. The Bull returned and sought for her,
    but never could find her.</p>
    <p>Long she sat, and aye she wept, till she wearied. At last she rose
    and went away, she didn't know where. On she wandered, till she came
    to a great hill of glass, that she tried all she could to climb, but
    wasn't able. Round the bottom of the hill she went, sobbing and
    seeking a passage over, till at last she came to a smith's house; and
    the smith promised, if she would serve him seven years, he would make
    her iron shoon, wherewith she could climb over the glassy hill. At
    seven years' end she got her iron shoon, clomb the glassy hill, and
    chanced to come to the old washerwife's habitation. There she was told
    of a gallant young knight that had given in some clothes all over
    blood to wash, and whoever washed them was to be his wife. The old
    wife had washed till she was tired, and then she set her daughter at
    it, and both washed, and they washed, and they washed, in hopes of
    getting the young knight; but for all they could do they couldn't
    bring out a stain. At length they set the stranger damsel to work; and
    whenever she began, the stains came out pure and clean, and the old
    wife made the knight believe it was her daughter had washed the
    clothes. So the knight and the eldest daughter were to be married, and
    the stranger damsel was distracted at the thought of it, for she was
    deeply in love with him. So she bethought her of her apple and
    breaking it, found it filled with gold and precious jewellery, the
    richest she had ever seen. "All these," she said to the eldest
    daughter, "I will give you, on condition that you put off your
    marriage for one day and allow me to go into his room alone at night."
    The lady consented; but meanwhile the old wife had prepared a sleeping
    drink, and given it to the knight who drank it, and never wakened till
    next morning. The live-long night the damsel sobbed and sang:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Seven long years I served for
    thee,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The glassy hill I clomb for

    <p>Next day she knew not what to do for grief. Then she broke the
    pear, and found it filled with jewellery far richer than the contents
    of the apple. With these jewels she bargained for permission to be a
    second night in the young knight's chamber; but the old wife gave him
    another sleeping drink, and again he slept till morning. All night she
    kept sighing and singing as before:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Seven long years I served for
    thee,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The glassy hill I clomb for

    thee;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And wilt thou not waken and turn to
    me?"</span><br />

    <p>Still he slept, and she nearly lost hope altogether, But that day,
    when he was out hunting, somebody asked him what noise and moaning was
    that they heard all last night in his bedchamber. He said: "I have
    heard no noise." But they assured him there was; and he resolved to
    keep waking that night to try what he could hear. That being the third
    night and the damsel being between hope and despair, she broke her
    plum, and it held far the richest jewellery of the three. She
    bargained as before; and the old wife, as before, took in the sleeping
    drink to the young knight's chamber; but he told her he couldn't drink
    it that night without sweetening. And when she went away for some
    honey to sweeten it with, he poured out the drink, and so made the old
    wife think he had drunk it. They all went to bed again, and the damsel
    began, as before, singing:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Seven long years I served for
    thee,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The glassy hill I clomb for

     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And wilt thou not waken and turn to
    me?"</span><br />

    <p>He heard, and turned to her. And she told him all that had befallen
    her, and he told her all that had happened to him. And he caused the
    old washerwife and her daughter to be burnt. And they were married,
    and he and she are living happy to this day for aught I know.</p>

    <h2>Yallery Brown</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time, and a very good time it was, though it wasn't in
    my time, nor in your time, nor any one else's time, there was a young
    lad of eighteen or so named Tom Tiver working on the Hall Farm. One
    Sunday he was walking across the west field, 't was a beautiful July
    night, warm and still and the air was full of little sounds as though
    the trees and grass were chattering to themselves. And all at once
    there came a bit ahead of him the pitifullest greetings ever he heard,
    sob, sobbing, like a bairn spent with fear, and nigh heartbroken;
    breaking off into a moan and then rising again in a long whimpering
    wailing that made him feel sick to hark to it. He began to look
    everywhere for the poor creature. "It must be Sally Bratton's child,"
    he thought to himself; "she was always a flighty thing, and never
    looked after it. Like as not, she's flaunting about the lanes, and has
    clean forgot the babby." But though he looked and looked, he could see
    nought. And presently the whimpering got louder and stronger in the
    quietness, and he thought he could make out words of some sort. He
    hearkened with all his ears, and the sorry thing was saying words all
    mixed up with sobbing&mdash;</p>
    <p>"Ooh! the stone, the great big stone! ooh! the stones on top!"</p>
    <p>Naturally he wondered where the stone might be, and he looked
    again, and there by the hedge bottom was a great flat stone, nigh
    buried in the mools, and hid in the cotted grass and weeds. One of the
    stones was called the "Strangers' Table." However, down he fell on his
    knee-bones by that stone, and hearkened again. Clearer than ever, but
    tired and spent with greeting came the little sobbing
    voice&mdash;"Ooh! ooh! the stone, the stone on top." He was gey, and
    mis-liking to meddle with the thing, but he couldn't stand the
    whimpering babby, and he tore like mad at the stone, till he felt it
    lifting from the mools, and all at once it came with a sough out o'
    the damp earth and the tangled grass and growing things. And there in
    the hole lay a tiddy thing on its back, blinking up at the moon and at
    him. 'T was no bigger than a year-old baby, but it had long cotted
    hair and beard, twisted round and round its body so that you couldn't
    see its clothes; and the hair was all yaller and shining and silky,
    like a bairn's; but the face of it was old and as if 't were hundreds
    of years since 't was young and smooth. Just a heap of wrinkles, and
    two bright black eyne in the midst, set in a lot of shining yaller
    hair; and the skin was the colour of the fresh turned earth in the
    spring&mdash;brown as brown could be, and its bare hands and feet were
    brown like the face of it. The greeting had stopped, but the tears
    were standing on its cheek, and the tiddy thing looked mazed like in
    the moonshine and the night air.</p>
    <p>The creature's eyne got used like to the moonlight, and presently
    he looked up in Tom's face as bold as ever was; "Tom," says he, "thou
    'rt a good lad!" as cool as thou can think, says he, "Tom, thou 'rt a
    good lad!" and his voice was soft and high and piping like a little
    bird twittering.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus043.jpg' width='490' height='300'
      alt='"Just a heap of wrinkles, and two bright black eyne in the midst, set in a lot of shining yaller hair."'
       border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>Tom touched his hat, and began to think what he ought to say.
    "Houts!" says the thing again, "thou needn't be feared o' me; thou 'st
    done me a better turn than thou know'st, my lad, and I'll do as much
    for thee." Tom couldn't speak yet, but he thought; "Lord! for sure 't
    is a bogle!"</p>
    <p>"No!" says he as quick as quick, "I am no bogle, but ye 'd best not
    ask me what I be; anyways I be a good friend o' thine." Tom's very
    knee-bones struck, for certainly an ordinary body couldn't have known
    what he'd been thinking to himself, but he looked so kind like, and
    spoke so fair, that he made bold to get out, a bit quavery
    like&mdash;</p>
    <p>"Might I be axing to know your honour's name?"</p>
    <p>"H'm," says he, pulling his beard; "as for that"&mdash;and he
    thought a bit&mdash;"ay so," he went on at last, "Yallery Brown thou
    mayst call me, Yallery Brown; 't is my nature seest thou, and as for a
    name 't will do as any other. Yallery Brown, Tom, Yallery Brown's thy
    friend, my lad."</p>
    <p>"Thankee, master," says Tom, quite meek like.</p>
    <p>"And now," he says, "I'm in a hurry to-night, but tell me quick,
    what'll I do for thee? Wilt have a wife? I can give thee the finest
    lass in the town. Wilt be rich? I'll give thee gold as much as thou
    can carry. Or wilt have help wi' thy work? Only say the word."</p>
    <p>Tom scratched his head. "Well, as for a wife, I have no hankering
    after such; they're but bothersome bodies, and I have women folk at
    home as 'll mend my clouts; and for gold that's as may be, but for
    work, there, I can't abide work, and if thou 'lt give me a helpin'
    hand in it I'll thank&mdash;"</p>
    <p>"Stop," says he, quick as lightning, "I'll help thee and welcome,
    but if ever thou sayest that to me&mdash;if ever thou thankest me,
    see'st thou, thou 'lt never see me more. Mind that now; I want no
    thanks, I'll have no thanks;" and he stampt his tiddy foot on the
    earth and looked as wicked as a raging bull.</p>
    <p>"Mind that now, great lump that thou be," he went on, calming down
    a bit, "and if ever thou need'st help, or get'st into trouble, call on
    me and just say, 'Yallery Brown, come from the mools, I want thee!'
    and I'll be wi' thee at once; and now," says he, picking a dandelion
    puff, "good-night to thee," and he blowed it up, and it all came into
    Tom's eyne and ears. Soon as Tom could see again the tiddy creature
    was gone, and but for the stone on end and the hole at his feet, he'd
    have thought he'd been dreaming.</p>
    <p>Well, Tom went home and to bed; and by the morning he'd nigh forgot
    all about it. But when he went to the work, there was none to do! all
    was done already, the horses seen to, the stables cleaned out,
    everything in its proper place, and he'd nothing to do but sit with
    his hands in his pockets. And so it went on day after day, all the
    work done by Yallery Brown, and better done, too, than he could have
    done it himself. And if the master gave him more work, he sat down,
    and the work did itself, the singeing irons, or the broom, or what
    not, set to, and with ne'er a hand put to it would get through in no
    time. For he never saw Yallery Brown in daylight; only in the darklins
    he saw him hopping about, like a Will-o-th'-wyke without his
    lanthorn.</p>
    <p>At first 't was mighty fine for Tom; he'd nought to do and good pay
    for it; but by-and-by things began to grow vicey-varsy. If the work
    was done for Tom, 't was undone for the other lads; if his buckets
    were filled, theirs were upset; if his tools were sharpened, theirs
    were blunted and spoiled; if his horses were clean as daisies, theirs
    were splashed with muck, and so on; day in and day out, 't was the
    same. And the lads saw Yallery Brown flitting about o' nights, and
    they saw the things working without hands o' days, and they saw that
    Tom's work was done for him, and theirs undone for them; and naturally
    they begun to look shy on him, and they wouldn't speak or come nigh
    him, and they carried tales to the master and so things went from bad
    to worse.</p>
    <p>For Tom could do nothing himself; the brooms wouldn't stay in his
    hand, the plough ran away from him, the hoe kept out of his grip. He
    thought that he'd do his own work after all, so that Yallery Brown
    would leave him and his neighbours alone. But he couldn't&mdash;true
    as death he couldn't. He could only sit by and look on, and have the
    cold shoulder turned on him, while the unnatural thing was meddling
    with the others, and working for him.</p>
    <p>At last, things got so bad that the master gave Tom the sack, and
    if he hadn't, all the rest of the lads would have sacked him, for they
    swore they'd not stay on the same garth with Tom. Well, naturally Tom
    felt bad; 't was a very good place, and good pay too; and he was fair
    mad with Yallery Brown, as 'd got him into such a trouble. So Tom
    shook his fist in the air and called out as loud as he could, "Yallery
    Brown, come from the mools; thou scamp, I want thee!"</p>
    <p>You'll scarce believe it, but he'd hardly brought out the words but
    he felt something tweaking his leg behind, while he jumped with the
    smart of it; and soon as he looked down, there was the tiddy thing,
    with his shining hair, and wrinkled face, and wicked glinting black
    eyne.</p>
    <p>Tom was in a fine rage, and he would have liked to have kicked him,
    but 't was no good, there wasn't enough of it to get his boot against;
    but he said, "Look here, master, I'll thank thee to leave me alone
    after this, dost hear? I want none of thy help, and I'll have nought
    more to do with thee&mdash;see now."</p>
    <p>The horrid thing broke into a screeching laugh, and pointed its
    brown finger at Tom. "Ho, ho, Tom!" says he. "Thou 'st thanked me, my
    lad, and I told thee not, I told thee not!"</p>
    <p>"I don't want thy help, I tell thee," Tom yelled at him&mdash;"I
    only want never to see thee again, and to have nought more to do with
    'ee&mdash;thou can go."</p>
    <p>The thing only laughed and screeched and mocked, as long as Tom
    went on swearing, but so soon as his breath gave out&mdash;</p>
    <p>"Tom, my lad," he said with a grin, "I'll tell 'ee summat, Tom.
    True's true I'll never help thee again, and call as thou wilt, thou
    'lt never see me after to-day; but I never said that I'd leave thee
    alone, Tom, and I never will, my lad! I was nice and safe under the
    stone, Tom, and could do no harm; but thou let me out thyself, and
    thou can't put me back again! I would have been thy friend and worked
    for thee if thou had been wise; but since thou bee'st no more than a
    born fool I'll give 'ee no more than a born fool's luck; and when all
    goes vicey-varsy, and everything agee&mdash;thou 'lt mind that it's
    Yallery Brown's doing though m'appen thou doesn't see him. Mark my
    words, will 'ee?"</p>
    <p>And he began to sing, dancing round Tom, like a bairn with his
    yellow hair, but looking older than ever with his grinning wrinkled
    bit of a face:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 6.5em;'>"Work as thou will</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 7em;'>Thou 'lt never do well;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 7em;'>Work as thou mayst</span><br />

    Brown</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Thou 'st let out thyself from under
    the stone."</span><br />

    <p>Tom could never rightly mind what he said next. 'T was all cussing
    and calling down misfortune on him; but he was so mazed in fright that
    he could only stand there shaking all over, and staring down at the
    horrid thing; and if he'd gone on long, Tom would have tumbled down in
    a fit. But by-and-by, his yaller shining hair rose up in the air, and
    wrapt itself round him till he looked for all the world like a great
    dandelion puff; and it floated away on the wind over the wall and out
    o' sight, with a parting skirl of wicked voice and sneering laugh.</p>
    <p>And did it come true, sayst thou? My word! but it did, sure as
    death! He worked here and he worked there, and turned his hand to this
    and to that, but it always went agee, and 't was all Yallery Brown's
    doing. And the children died, and the crops rotted&mdash;the beasts
    never fatted, and nothing ever did well with him; and till he was dead
    and buried, and m'appen even afterwards, there was no end to Yallery
    Brown's spite at him; day in and day out he used to hear him
    saying&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 7em;'>"Work as thou wilt</span><br />

    <h2>Three Feathers</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time there was a girl who was married to a husband that
    she never saw. And the way this was, was that he was only at home at
    night, and would never have any light in the house. The girl thought
    that was funny, and all her friends told her there must be something
    wrong with her husband, some great deformity that made him want not to
    be seen.</p>
    <p>Well, one night when he came home she suddenly lit a candle and saw
    him. He was handsome enough to make all the women of the world fall in
    love with him. But scarcely had she seen him when he began to change
    into a bird, and then he said: "Now you have seen me, you shall see me
    no more, unless you are willing to serve seven years and a day for me,
    so that I may become a man once more." Then he told her to take three
    feathers from under his side, and whatever she wished through them
    would come to pass. Then he left her at a great house to be
    laundry-maid for seven years and a day.</p>
    <p>And the girl used to take the feathers and say:</p>
    <p>"By virtue of my three feathers may the copper be lit, and the
    clothes washed, and mangled, and folded, and put away to the missus's
    satisfaction."</p>
    <p>And then she had no more care about it. The feathers did the rest,
    and the lady set great store by her for a better laundress she had
    never had. Well, one day the butler, who had a notion to have the
    pretty laundry-maid for his wife, said to her, he should have spoken
    before but he did not want to vex her. "Why should it when I am but a
    fellow-servant?" the girl said. And then he felt free to go on, and
    explain he had &pound;70 laid by with the master, and how would she
    like him for a husband.</p>
    <p>And the girl told him to fetch her the money, and he asked his
    master for it, and brought it to her. But as they were going
    up-stairs, she cried, "O John, I must go back, sure I've left my
    shutters undone, and they'll be slashing and banging all night."</p>
    <p>The butler said, "Never you trouble, I'll put them right." and he
    ran back, while she took her feathers, and said: "By virtue of my
    three feathers may the shutters slash and bang till morning, and John
    not be able to fasten them nor yet to get his fingers free from
    them."</p>
    <p>And so it was. Try as he might the butler could not leave hold, nor
    yet keep the shutters from blowing open as he closed them. And he
    <i>was</i> angry, but could not help himself, and he did not care to
    tell of it and get the laugh on him, so no one knew.</p>
    <p>Then after a bit the coachman began to notice her, and she found he
    had some &pound;40 with the master, and he said she might have it if
    she would take him with it.</p>
    <p>So after the laundry-maid had his money in her apron as they went
    merrily along, she stopt, exclaiming: "My clothes are left outside, I
    must run back and bring them in." "Stop for me while I go; it is a
    cold frost night," said William, "you'd be catching your death." So
    the girl waited long enough to take her feathers out and say, "By
    virtue of my three feathers may the clothes slash and blow about till
    morning, and may William not be able to take his hand from them nor
    yet to gather them up." And then she was away to bed and to sleep.</p>

      border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>The coachman did not want to be every one's jest, and he said
    nothing. So after a bit the footman comes to her and said he: "I have
    been with my master for years and have saved up a good bit, and you
    have been three years here, and must have saved up as well. Let us put
    it together, and make us a home or else stay on at service as pleases
    you." Well, she got him to bring the savings to her as the others had,
    and then she pretended she was faint, and said to him: "James, I feel
    so queer, run down cellar for me, that's a dear, and fetch me up a
    drop of brandy." Now no sooner had he started than she said: "By
    virtue of my three feathers may there be slashing and spilling, and
    James not be able to pour the brandy straight nor yet to take his hand
    from it until morning."</p>
    <p>And so it was. Try as he might James could not get his glass
    filled, and there was slashing and spilling, and right on it all, down
    came the master to know what it meant!</p>
    <p>So James told him he could not make it out, but he could not get
    the drop of brandy the laundry-maid had asked for, and his hand would
    shake and spill everything, and yet come away he could not.</p>
    <p>This got him in for a regular scrape, and the master when he got
    back to his wife said: "What has come over the men, they were all
    right until that laundry-maid of yours came. Something is up now
    though. They have all drawn out their pay, and yet they don't leave,
    and what can it be anyway?"</p>
    <p>But his wife said she could not hear of the laundry-maid being
    blamed, for she was the best servant she had and worth all the rest
    put together.</p>
    <p>So it went on until one day as the girl stood in the hall door, the
    coachman happened to say to the footman: "Do you know how that girl
    served me, James?" And then William told about the clothes. The butler
    put in, "That was nothing to what she served me," and he told of the
    shutters clapping all night.</p>
    <p>Just then the master came through the hall, and the girl said: "By
    virtue of my three feathers may there be slashing and striving between
    master and men, and may all get splashed in the pond."</p>
    <p>And so it was, the men fell to disputing which had suffered the
    most by her, and when the master came up all would be heard at once
    and none listened to him, and it came to blows all round, and the
    first they knew they had shoved one another into the pond.</p>
    <p>When the girl thought they had had enough she took the spell off,
    and the master asked her what had begun the row, for he had not heard
    in the confusion.</p>
    <p>And the girl said: "They were ready to fall on any one; they'd have
    beat me if you had not come by."</p>
    <p>So it blew over for that time, and through her feathers she made
    the best laundress ever known. But to make a long story short, when
    the seven years and a day were up, the bird-husband, who had known her
    doings all along, came after her, restored to his own shape again. And
    he told her mistress he had come to take her from being a servant, and
    that she should have servants under her. But he did not tell of the
    feathers.</p>
    <p>And then he bade her give the men back their savings.</p>
    <p>"That was a rare game you had with them," said he, "but now you are
    going where there is plenty, leave them each their own." So she did;
    and they drove off to their castle, where they lived happy ever
    after.</p>

    <h2>Sir Gammer Vans</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Last Sunday morning at six o'clock in the evening as I was sailing
    over the tops of the mountains in my little boat, I met two men on
    horseback riding on one mare: So I asked them, "Could they tell me
    whether the little old woman was dead yet who was hanged last Saturday
    week for drowning herself in a shower of feathers?" They said they
    could not positively inform me, but if I went to Sir Gammer Vans he
    could tell me all about it. "But how am I to know the house?" said I.
    "Ho, 't is easy enough," said they, "for 't is a brick house, built
    entirely of flints, standing alone by itself in the middle of sixty or
    seventy others just like it."</p>
    <p>"Oh, nothing in the world is easier," said I.</p>
    <p>"Nothing <i>can</i> be easier," said they: so I went on my way.</p>
    <p>Now this Sir G. Vans was a giant, and a bottle-maker. And as all
    giants who <i>are</i> bottle-makers usually pop out of a little
    thumb-bottle from behind the door, so did Sir G. Vans.</p>
    <p>"How d'ye do?" says he.</p>
    <p>"Very well, I thank you," says I.</p>
    <p>"Have some breakfast with me?"</p>
    <p>"With all my heart," says I.</p>
    <p>So he gave me a slice of beer, and a cup of cold veal; and there
    was a little dog under the table that picked up all the crumbs.</p>
    <p>"Hang him," says I.</p>
    <p>"No, don't hang him," says he; "for he killed a hare yesterday. And
    if you don't believe me, I'll show you the hare alive in a
    basket."</p>
    <p>So he took me into his garden to show me the curiosities. In one
    corner there was a fox hatching eagle's eggs; in another there was an
    iron apple tree, entirely covered with pears and lead; in the third
    there was the hare which the dog killed yesterday alive in the basket;
    and in the fourth there were twenty-four <i>hipper switches</i>
    threshing tobacco, and at the sight of me they threshed so hard that
    they drove the plug through the wall, and through a little dog that
    was passing by on the other side. I, hearing the dog howl, jumped over
    the wall; and turned it as neatly inside out as possible, when it ran
    away as if it had not an hour to live. Then he took me into the park
    to show me his deer: and I remembered that I had a warrant in my
    pocket to shoot venison for his majesty's dinner. So I set fire to my
    bow, poised my arrow, and shot amongst them. I broke seventeen ribs on
    one side, and twenty-one and a half on the other; but my arrow passed
    clean through without ever touching it, and the worst was I lost my
    arrow: however, I found it again in the hollow of a tree. I felt it;
    it felt clammy. I smelt it; it smelt honey. "Oh, ho," said I, "here's
    a bee's nest," when out sprang a covey of partridges. I shot at them;
    some say I killed eighteen; but I am sure I killed thirty-six, besides
    a dead salmon which was flying over the bridge, of which I made the
    best apple-pie I ever tasted.</p>

    <h2>Tom Hickathrift</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Before the days of William the Conqueror there dwelt a man in the
    marsh of the Isle of Ely whose name was Thomas Hickathrift, a poor day
    labourer, but so stout that he could do two days' work in one. His one
    son he called by his own name, Thomas Hickathrift, and he put him to
    good learning, but the lad was none of the wisest, and indeed seemed
    to be somewhat soft, so he got no good at all from his teaching.</p>
    <p>Tom's father died, and his mother being tender of him, kept him as
    well as she could. The slothful fellow would do nothing but sit in the
    chimney-corner, and eat as much at a time as would serve four or five
    ordinary men. And so much did he grow that when but ten years old he
    was already eight feet high, and his hand like a shoulder of
    mutton.</p>
    <p>One day his mother went to a rich farmer's house to beg a bottle of
    straw for herself and Tom. "Take what you will," said the farmer, an
    honest charitable man. So when she got home she told Tom to fetch the
    straw, but he wouldn't and, beg as she might, he wouldn't till she
    borrowed him a cart rope. So off he went, and when he came to the
    farmer's, master and men were all a-trashing in the barn.</p>
    <p>"I'm come for the straw," said Tom.</p>
    <p>"Take as much as thou canst carry," said the farmer.</p>
    <p>So Tom laid down his rope and began to make his bottle.</p>
    <p>"Your rope is too short," said the farmer by way of a joke; but the
    joke was on Tom's side, for when he had made up his load there was
    some twenty hundred-weight of straw, and though they called him a fool
    for thinking he could carry the tithe of it, he flung it over his
    shoulder as if it had been a hundred-weight, to the great admiration
    of master and men.</p>
    <p>Tom's strength being thus made known there was no longer any
    basking by the fire for him; every one would be hiring him to work,
    and telling him 't was a shame to live such a lazy life. So Tom seeing
    them wait on him as they did, went to work first with one, then with
    another. And one day a woodman desired his help to bring home a tree.
    Off went Tom and four men besides, and when they came to the tree they
    began to draw it into the cart with pulleys. At last Tom, seeing them
    unable to lift it, "Stand away, you fools," said he, and taking the
    tree, set it on one end and laid it in the cart. "Now," said he, "see
    what a man can do." "Marry, 't is true," said they, and the woodman
    asked what reward he'd take. "Oh, a stick for my mother's fire," said
    Tom; and espying a tree bigger than was in the cart, he laid it on his
    shoulders and went home with it as fast as the cart and six horses
    could draw it.</p>
    <p>Tom now saw that he had more strength than twenty men, and began to
    be very merry, taking delight in company, in going to fairs and
    meetings, in seeing sports and pastimes. And at cudgels, wrestling, or
    throwing the hammer, not a man could stand against him, so that at
    last none durst go into the ring to wrestle with him, and his fame was
    spread more and more in the country.</p>
    <p>Far and near he would go to any meetings, as football play or the
    like. And one day in a part of the country where he was a stranger,
    and none knew him, he stopped to watch the company at football play;
    rare sport it was; but Tom spoiled it all, for meeting the ball he
    took it such a kick that away it flew none could tell whither. They
    were angry with Tom as you may fancy, but got nothing by that as Tom
    took hold of a big spar, and laid about with a will, so that though
    the whole country-side was up in arms against him, he cleared his way
    wherever he came.</p>
    <p>It was late in the evening ere he could turn homeward, and on the
    road there met him four lusty rogues that had been robbing passengers
    all day. They thought they had a good prize in Tom, who was all alone,
    and made cocksure of his money.</p>
    <p>"Stand and deliver!" said they.</p>
    <p>"What should I deliver?" said Tom.</p>
    <p>"Your money, sirrah," said they.</p>
    <p>"You shall give me better words for it first," said Tom.</p>
    <p>"Come, come, no more prating; money we want, and money we'll have
    before you stir."</p>
    <p>"Is it so?" said Tom, "nay, then come and take it."</p>
    <p>The long and the short of it was that Tom killed two of the rogues
    and grieviously wounded the other two, and took all their money, which
    was as much as two hundred pounds. And when he came home he made his
    old mother laugh with the story of how he served the football players
    and the four thieves.</p>
    <p>But you shall see that Tom sometimes met his match. In wandering
    one day in the forest he met a lusty tinker that had a good staff on
    his shoulder, and a great dog to carry his bag and tools.</p>
    <p>"Whence come you and whither are you going?" said Tom, "this is no
    highway."</p>
    <p>"What's that to you?" said the tinker; "fools must needs be
    meddling."</p>
    <p>"I'll make you know," said Tom, "before you and I part, what it is
    to me."</p>
    <p>"Well," said the tinker, "I'm ready for a bout with any man, and I
    hear there is one Tom Hickathrift in the country of whom great things
    are told. I'd fain see him to have a turn with him."</p>
    <p>"Ay," said Tom, "methinks he might be master with you. Anyhow, I am
    the man; what have you to say to me?"</p>
    <p>"Why, verily, I'm glad we are so happily met."</p>
    <p>"Sure, you do but jest," said Tom.</p>
    <p>"Marry, I'm in earnest," said the tinker. "A match?" "'T is done."
    "Let me first get a twig," said Tom. "Ay," said the tinker, "hang him
    that would fight a man unarmed."</p>
    <p>So Tom took a gate-rail for his staff, and at it they fell, the
    tinker at Tom, and Tom at the tinker, like two giants they laid on at
    each other. The tinker had a leathern coat on, and at every blow Tom
    gave the tinker his coat roared again, yet the tinker did not give way
    one inch. At last Tom gave him a blow on the side of his head which
    felled him.</p>
    <p>"Now tinker where are you?" said Tom.</p>
    <p>But the tinker being a nimble fellow, leapt up again, gave Tom a
    blow that made him reel again, and followed his blow with one on the
    other side that made Tom's neck crack again. So Tom flung down his
    weapon and yielded the tinker the better on it, took him home to his
    house, where they nursed their bruises and from that day forth there
    was no stauncher pair of friends than they two.</p>
    <p>Tom's fame was thus spread abroad till at length a brewer at Lynn,
    wanting a good lusty man to carry his beer to Wisbeach went to hire
    Tom, and promised him a new suit of clothes from top to toe, and that
    he should eat and drink of the best, so Tom yielded to be his man and
    his master told him what way he should go, for you must understand
    there was a monstrous giant who kept part of the marsh-land, so that
    none durst go that way.</p>
    <p>So Tom went every day to Wisbeach a good twenty miles by the road.
    'T was a wearisome journey thought Tom and he soon found that the way
    kept by the giant was nearer by half. Now Tom had got more strength
    than ever, being well kept as he was and drinking so much strong ale
    as he did. One day, then, as he was going to Wisbeach, without saying
    anything to his master or any of his fellow servants, he resolved to
    take the nearest road or to lose his life; as they say, to win horse
    or lose saddle. Thus resolved, he took the near road, flinging open
    the gates for his cart and horses to go through. At last the giant
    spied him, and came up speedily, intending to take his beer for a
    prize.</p>
    <p>He met Tom like a lion as though he would have swallowed him. "Who
    gave you authority to come this way?" roared he. "I'll make you an
    example for all rogues under the sun. See how many heads hang on
    yonder tree. Yours shall hang higher than all the rest for a
    warning."</p>
    <p>But Tom made him answer, "A fig in your teeth you shall not find me
    like one of them, traitorly rogue that you are."</p>
    <p>The giant took these words in high disdain, and ran into his cave
    to fetch his great club, intending to dash out Tom's brains at the
    first blow.</p>
    <p>Tom knew not what to do for a weapon; his whip would be but little
    good against a monstrous beast twelve foot in length and six foot
    about the waist. But whilst the giant went for his club, bethinking
    him of a very good weapon, he made no more ado, but took his cart,
    turned it upside down, and took axle-tree and wheel for shield and
    buckler. And very good weapons they were found!</p>
    <p>Out came the giant and began to stare at Tom. "You are like to do
    great service with those weapons," roared he. "I have here a twig that
    will beat you and your wheel to the ground." Now this twig was as
    thick as some mileposts are, but Tom was not daunted for all that,
    though the giant made at him with such force that the wheel cracked
    again. But Tom gave as good as he got, taking the giant such a weighty
    blow on the side of the head that he reeled again. "What," said Tom,
    "are you drunk with my strong beer already?"</p>
    <p>So at it they went, Tom laying such huge blows at the giant, down
    whose face sweat and blood ran together, so that, being fat and foggy
    and tired with the long fighting, he asked Tom would he let him drink
    a little? "Nay, nay," said Tom, "my mother did not teach me such wit;
    who'd be a fool then?" And seeing the giant beginning to weary and fail
    in his blows, Tom thought best to make hay whilst the sun shone, and,
    laying on as fast as though he had been mad, he brought the giant to
    the ground. In vain were the giant's roars and prayers and promises to
    yield himself and be Tom's servant. Tom laid at him till he was dead,
    and then, cutting off his head, he went into the cave, and found a
    great store of silver and gold, which made his heart to leap. So he
    loaded his cart, and after delivering his beer at Wisbeach, he came
    home and told his master what had befallen him. And on the morrow he
    and his master and more of the towns-folk of Lynn set out for the
    giant's cave. Tom showed them the head, and what silver and gold there
    was in the cave, and not a man but leapt for joy, for the giant was a
    great enemy to all the country.</p>
    <p>The news was spread all up and down the country-side how Tom
    Hickathrift had killed the giant. And well was he that could run to
    see the cave; all the folk made bonfires for joy, and if Tom was
    respected before, he was much more so now. With common consent he took
    possession of the cave and every one said, had it been twice as much,
    he would have deserved it. So Tom pulled down the cave, and built
    himself a brave house. The ground that the giant kept by force for
    himself, Tom gave part to the poor for their common land, and part he
    turned into good wheat-land to keep himself and his old mother, Jane
    Hickathrift. And now he was become the chiefest man in the
    country-side; 't was no longer plain Tom, but Mr. Hickathrift, and he
    was held in due respect I promise you. He kept men and maids and lived
    most bravely; made him a park to keep deer, and time passed with him
    happily in his great house till the end of his days.</p>

    <h2>The Hedley Kow</h2>
    <br />

    <p>There was once an old woman, who earned a poor living by going
    errands and such like, for the farmers' wives round about the village
    where she lived. It wasn't much she earned by it; but with a plate of
    meat at one house, and a cup of tea at another, she made shift to get
    on somehow, and always looked as cheerful as if she hadn't a want in
    the world.</p>
    <p>Well, one summer evening as she was trotting away homewards, she
    came upon a big black pot lying at the side of the road.</p>
    <p>"Now <i>that</i>," said she, stopping to look at it, "would be just
    the very thing for me if I had anything to put into it! But who can
    have left it here?" and she looked round about, as if the person it
    belonged to must be not far off. But she could see no one.</p>
    <p>"Maybe it'll have a hole in it," she said thoughtfully:&mdash;</p>
    <p>"Ay, that'll be how they've left it lying, hinny. But then it 'd do
    fine to put a flower in for the window; I'm thinking I'll just take it
    home, anyways." And she bent her stiff old back, and lifted the lid to
    look inside.</p>
    <p>"Mercy me!" she cried, and jumped back to the other side of the
    road; "<i>if it is fit brim full o' gold</i> PIECES!!"</p>
    <p>For a while she could do nothing but walk round and round her
    treasure, admiring the yellow gold and wondering at her good luck, and
    saying to herself about every two minutes, "Well, I <i>do</i> be
    feeling rich and grand!" But presently she began to think how she
    could best take it home with her; and she couldn't see any other way
    than by fastening one end of her shawl to it, and so dragging it after
    her along the road.</p>
    <p>"It'll certainly be soon dark," she said to herself, "and folk'll
    not see what I'm bringing home with me, and so I'll have all the night
    to myself to think what I'll do with it. I could buy a grand house and
    all, and live like the Queen herself, and not do a stroke of work all
    day, but just sit by the fire with a cup of tea; or maybe I'll give it
    to the priest to keep for me, and get a piece as I'm wanting; or maybe
    I'll just bury it in a hole at the garden-foot, and put a bit on the
    chimney, between the chiney teapot and the spoons&mdash;for ornament
    like. Ah! I feel so grand, I don't know myself rightly!"</p>
    <p>And by this time, being already rather tired with dragging such a
    heavy weight after her, she stopped to rest for a minute, turning to
    make sure that her treasure was safe.</p>
    <p>But when she looked at it, it wasn't a pot of gold at all, but a
    great lump of shining silver!</p>
    <p>She stared at it, and rubbed her eyes and stared at it again; but
    she couldn't make it look like anything but a great lump of silver.
    "I'd have sworn it was a pot of gold," she said at last, "but I reckon
    I must have been dreaming. Ay, now, that's a change for the better;
    it'll be far less trouble to look after, and none so easy stolen; yon
    gold pieces would have been a sight of bother to keep 'em safe. Ay,
    I'm well quit of them; and with my bonny lump I'm as rich as
    rich&mdash;!"</p>
    <p>And she set off homewards again, cheerfully planning all the grand
    things she was going to do with her money. It wasn't very long,
    however, before she got tired again and stopped once more to rest for
    a minute or two.</p>
    <p>Again she turned to look at her treasure, and as soon as she set
    eyes on it she cried out in astonishment. "Oh, my!" said she; "now
    it's a lump o' iron! Well, that beats all; and it's just real
    convenient! I can sell it as <i>easy</i> as <i>easy</i>, and get a lot
    o' penny pieces for it. Ay, hinny, an' it's much handier than a lot o'
    yer gold and silver as 'd have kept me from sleeping o' nights
    thinking the neighbours were robbing me&mdash;an' it's a real good
    thing to have by you in a house, ye niver can tell what ye mightn't
    use it for, an' it'll sell&mdash;ay, for a real lot. Rich? I'll be
    just <i>rolling!</i>"</p>
    <p>And on she trotted again chuckling to herself on her good luck,
    till presently she glanced over her shoulder, "just to make sure it
    was there still," as she said to herself.</p>
    <p>"Eh, my!" she cried as soon as she saw it; "if it hasn't gone and
    turned itself into a great stone this time! Now, how could it have
    known that I was just <i>terrible</i> wanting something to hold my
    door open with? Ay, if that isn't a good change! Hinny, it's a fine
    thing to have such good luck."</p>
    <p>And, all in a hurry to see how the stone would look in its corner
    by her door, she trotted off down the hill, and stopped at the foot,
    beside her own little gate.</p>
    <p>When she had unlatched it, she turned to unfasten her shawl from
    the stone, which this time seemed to lie unchanged and peaceably on
    the path beside her, There was still plenty of light, and she could
    see the stone quite plainly as she bent her stiff back over it, to
    untie the shawl end; when, all of a sudden, it seemed to give a jump
    and a squeal, and grew in a moment as big as a great horse; then it
    threw down four lanky legs, and shook out two long ears, flourished a
    tail, and went off kicking its feet into the and laughing like a
    naughty mocking boy.</p>
    <p>The old woman stared after it, till it was fairly out of sight.</p>
    <p>"WELL!" she said at last, "I <i>do</i> be the luckiest body
    hereabouts! Fancy me seeing the Hedley Kow all to myself, and making
    so free with it too! I can tell you, I <i>do</i> feel that
    GRAND&mdash;"</p>
    <p>And she went into her cottage, and sat down by the fire to think
    over her good luck.</p>

    <h2>Gobborn Seer</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once there was a man Gobborn Seer, and he had a son called
    Jack.</p>
    <p>One day he sent him out to sell a sheep skin, and Gobborn said,
    "You must bring me back the skin and the value of it as well."</p>
    <p>So Jack started, but he could not find any who would leave him the
    skin and give him its price too. So he came home discouraged.</p>
    <p>But Gobborn Seer said, "Never mind, you must take another turn at
    it to-morrow."</p>
    <p>So he tried again, and nobody wished to buy the skin on those
    terms.</p>
    <p>When he came home his father said, "You must go and try your luck
    to-morrow," and the third day it seemed as if it would be the same
    thing over again. And he had half a mind not to go back at all, his
    father would be so vexed. As he came to a bridge, like the Creek Road
    one yonder, he leaned on the parapet thinking of his trouble, and that
    perhaps it would be foolish to run away from home, but he could not
    tell which to do; when he saw a girl washing her clothes on the bank
    below. She looked up and said:</p>
    <p>"If it may be no offence asking, what is it you feel so badly
    about?"</p>
    <p>"My father has given me this skin, and I am to fetch it back and
    the price of it beside."</p>
    <p>"Is that all? Give it here, and it's easy done."</p>
    <p>So the girl washed the skin in the stream, took the wool from it,
    and paid him the value of it, and gave him the skin to carry back.</p>
    <p>His father was well pleased, and said to Jack, "That was a witty
    woman; she would make you a good wife. Do you think you could tell her
    again?"</p>
    <p>Jack thought he could, so his father told him to go by-and-by to
    the bridge, and see if she was there, and if so bid her come home to
    take tea with them.</p>
    <p>And sure enough Jack spied her and told her how his old father had
    a wish to meet her, and would she be pleased to drink tea with
    them.</p>
    <p>The girl thanked him kindly, and said she could come the next day;
    she was too busy at the moment.</p>
    <p>"All the better," said Jack, "I'll have time to make ready."</p>
    <p>So when she came Gobborn Seer could see she was a witty woman, and
    he asked her if she would marry his Jack. She said "Yes," and they
    were married.</p>
    <p>Not long after, Jack's father told him he must come with him and
    build the finest castle that ever was seen, for a king who wished to
    outdo all others by his wonderful castle.</p>
    <p>And as they went to lay the foundation-stone, Gobborn Seer said to
    Jack, "Can't you shorten the way for me?"</p>
    <p>But Jack looked ahead and there was a long road before them, and he
    said, "I don't see, father, how I could break a bit off."</p>
    <p>"You're no good to me, then, and had best be off home."</p>
    <p>So poor Jack turned back, and when he came in his wife said, "Why,
    how's this you've come alone?" and he told her what his father had
    said and his answer.</p>
    <p>"You stupid," said his witty wife, "if you had told a tale you
    would have shortened the road! Now listen till I tell you a story, and
    then catch up with Gobborn Seer and begin it at once. He will like
    hearing it, and by the time you are done you will have reached the
    foundation-stone."</p>
    <p>So Jack sweated and overtook his father. Gobborn Seer said never a
    word, but Jack began his story, and the road was shortened as his wife
    had said.</p>
    <p>When they came to the end of their journey, they started building
    of this castle which was to outshine all others. Now the wife had
    advised them to be intimate with the servants, and so they did as she
    said, and it was "Good-morning" and "Good-day to you" as they passed
    in and out.</p>
    <p>Now, at the end of a twelvemonth, Gobborn, the wise man, had built
    such a castle thousands were gathered to admire it.</p>
    <p>And the king said: "The castle is done. I shall return to-morrow
    and pay you all."</p>
    <p>"I have just a ceiling to finish in an upper lobby," said Gobborn,
    "and then it wants nothing."</p>
    <p>But after the king was gone off, the housekeeper sent for Gobborn
    and Jack, and told them that she had watched for a chance to warn
    them, for the king was so afraid they should carry their art away and
    build some other king as fine a castle, he meant to take their lives
    on the morrow. Gobborn told Jack to keep a good heart, and they would
    come off all right.</p>
    <p>When the king had come back Gobborn told him he had been unable to
    complete the job for lack of a tool left at home, and he should like
    to send Jack after it.</p>
    <p>"No, no," said the king, "cannot one of the men do the errand?"</p>
    <p>"No, they could not make themselves understood," said the Seer,
    "but Jack could do the errand."</p>
    <p>"You and your son are to stop here. But how will it do if I send my
    own son?"</p>
    <p>"That will do."</p>
    <p>So Gobborn sent by him a message to Jack's wife. "Give him
    <i>Crooked and Straight</i>!"</p>
    <p>Now there was a little hole in the wall rather high up, and Jack's
    wife tried to reach up into a chest there after "crooked and
    straight," but at last she asked the king's son to help her, because
    his arms were longest.</p>
    <p>But when he was leaning over the chest she caught him by the two
    heels, and threw him into the chest, and fastened it down. So there he
    was, both "crooked and straight!"</p>
    <p>Then he begged for pen and ink, which she brought him, but he was
    not allowed out, and holes were bored that he might breathe.</p>
    <p>When his letter came, telling the king, his father, he was to be
    let free when Gobborn and Jack were safe home, the king saw he must
    settle for the building, and let them come away.</p>
    <p>As they left Gobborn told him: Now that Jack was done with this
    work, he should soon build a castle for his witty wife far superior to
    the king's, which he did, and they lived there happily ever after.</p>

    <h2>Tattercoats</h2>
    <br />

    <p>In a great Palace by the sea there once dwelt a very rich old lord,
    who had neither wife nor children living, only one little
    granddaughter, whose face he had never seen in all her life. He hated
    her bitterly, because at her birth his favourite daughter died; and
    when the old nurse brought him the baby, he swore, that it might live
    or die as it liked, but he would never look on its face as long as it
    lived.</p>
    <p>So he turned his back, and sat by his window looking out over the
    sea, and weeping great tears for his lost daughter, till his white
    hair and beard grew down over his shoulders and twined round his chair
    and crept into the chinks of the floor, and his tears, dropping on to
    the window-ledge, wore a channel through the stone, and ran away in a
    little river to the great sea. And, meanwhile, his granddaughter grew
    up with no one to care for her, or clothe her; only the old nurse,
    when no one was by, would sometimes give her a dish of scraps from the
    kitchen, or a torn petticoat from the rag-bag; while the other
    servants of the Palace would drive her from the house with blows and
    mocking words, calling her "Tattercoats," and pointing at her bare
    feet and shoulders, till she ran away crying, to hide among the
    bushes.</p>
    <p>And so she grew up, with little to eat or wear, spending her days
    in the fields and lanes, with only the gooseherd for a companion, who
    would play to her so merrily on his little pipe, when she was hungry,
    or cold, or tired, that she forgot all her troubles, and fell to
    dancing, with his flock of noisy geese for partners.</p>
    <p>But, one day, people told each other that the King was travelling
    through the land, and in the town near by was to give a great ball, to
    all the lords and ladies of the country, when the Prince, his only
    son, was to choose a wife.</p>
    <p>One of the royal invitations was brought to the Palace by the sea,
    and the servants carried it up to the old lord who still sat by his
    window, wrapped in his long white hair and weeping into the little
    river that was fed by his tears.</p>
    <p>But when he heard the King's command, he dried his eyes and bade
    them bring shears to cut him loose, for his hair had bound him a fast
    prisoner and he could not move. And then he sent them for rich
    clothes, and jewels, which he put on; and he ordered them to saddle
    the white horse, with gold and silk, that he might ride to meet the
    King.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile Tattercoats had heard of the great doings in the town,
    and she sat by the kitchen-door weeping because she could not go to
    see them. And when the old nurse heard her crying she went to the Lord
    of the Palace, and begged him to take his granddaughter with him to
    the King's ball.</p>
    <p>But he only frowned and told her to be silent, while the servants
    laughed and said: "Tattercoats is happy in her rags, playing with the
    gooseherd, let her be&mdash;it is all she is fit for."</p>
    <p>A second, and then a third time, the old nurse begged him to let
    the girl go with him, but she was answered only by black looks and
    fierce words, till she was driven from the room by the jeering
    servants, with blows and mocking words.</p>
    <p>Weeping over her ill-success, the old nurse went to look for
    Tattercoats; but the girl had been turned from the door by the cook,
    and had run away to tell her friend the gooseherd, how unhappy she was
    because she could not go to the King's ball.</p>
    <p>But when the gooseherd had listened to her story, he bade her cheer
    up, and proposed that they should go together into the town to see the
    King, and all the fine things; and when she looked sorrowfully down at
    her rags and bare feet, he played a note or two upon his pipe, so gay
    and merry, that she forgot all about her tears and her troubles, and
    before she well knew, the herdboy had taken her by the hand, and she,
    and he, and the geese before them, were dancing down the road towards
    the town.</p>
    <p>Before they had gone very far, a handsome young man, splendidly
    dressed, rode up and stopped to ask the way to the castle where the
    King was staying; and when he found that they too were going thither,
    he got off his horse and walked beside them along the road.</p>
    <p>The herdboy pulled out his pipe and played a low sweet tune, and
    the stranger looked again and again at Tattercoats' lovely face till
    he fell deeply in love with her, and begged her to marry him.</p>
    <p>But she only laughed, and shook her golden head.</p>
    <p>"You would be finely put to shame if you had a goosegirl for your
    wife!" said she; "go and ask one of the great ladies you will see
    to-night at the King's ball, and do not flout poor Tattercoats."</p>
    <p>But the more she refused him the sweeter the pipe played, and the
    deeper the young man fell in love; till at last he begged her, as a
    proof of his sincerity, to come that night at twelve to the King's
    ball, just as she was, with the herdboy and his geese, and in her torn
    petticoat and bare feet, and he would dance with her before the King
    and the lords and ladies, and present her to them all, as his dear and
    honoured bride.</p>
    <p>So when night came, and the hall in the castle was full of light
    and music, and the lords and ladies were dancing before the King, just
    as the clock struck twelve, Tattercoats and the herdboy, followed by
    his flock of noisy geese, entered at the great doors, and walked
    straight up the ball-room, while on either side the ladies whispered,
    the lords laughed, and the King seated at the far end stared in
    amazement.</p>
    <p>But as they came in front of the throne, Tattercoats' lover rose
    from beside the King, and came to meet her. Taking her by the hand, he
    kissed her thrice before them all, and turned to the King.</p>

    <p>"Father!" he said, for it was the Prince himself, "I have made my
    choice, and here is my bride, the loveliest girl in all the land, and
    the sweetest as well!"</p>
    <p>Before he had finished speaking, the herdboy put his pipe to his
    lips and played a few low notes that sounded like a bird singing far
    off in the woods; and as he played, Tattercoats' rags were changed to
    shining robes sewn with glittering jewels, a golden crown lay upon her
    golden hair, and the flock of geese behind her, became a crowd of
    dainty pages, bearing her long train.</p>
    <p>And as the King rose to greet her as his daughter, the trumpets
    sounded loudly in honour of the new Princess, and the people outside
    in the street said to each other:</p>
    <p>"Ah! now the Prince has chosen for his wife the loveliest girl in
    all the land!"</p>
    <p>But the gooseherd was never seen again, and no one knew what became
    of him; while the old lord went home once more to his Palace by the
    sea, for he could not stay at Court, when he had sworn never to look
    on his granddaughter's face.</p>
    <p>So there he still sits by his window, if you could only see him, as
    you some day may, weeping more bitterly than ever, as he looks out
    over the sea.</p>

    <p>There lived an old man and an old woman at the side of a burn. They
    had two cows, five hens, and a cock, a cat and two kittens. The old
    man looked after the cows, and the old wife span on the distaff. The
    kittens oft gripped at the old wife's spindle, as it tussled over the
    hearthstone. "Sho, sho," she would say, "go away;" and so it tussled
    about.</p>
    <p>One day, after breakfast, she thought she would have a bannock. So
    she baked two oatmeal bannocks, and set them on to the fire to harden.
    After a while, the old man came in, and sat down beside the fire, and
    takes one of the bannocks, and snaps it through the middle. When the
    other one sees this, it runs off as fast as it could, and the old wife
    after it, with the spindle in the one hand, and the distaff in the
    other. But the wee bannock ran away and out of sight, and ran till it
    came to a pretty large thatched house, and it ran boldly up inside to
    the fireside; and there were three tailors sitting on a big bench.
    When they saw the wee bannock come in, they jumped up, and got behind
    the goodwife, that was carding tow by the fire. "Hout," quoth she, "be
    no afeard; it's but a wee bannock. Grip it, and I'll give ye a sup of
    milk with it." Up she gets with the tow-cards and the tailor with the
    goose, and the two 'prentices, the one with the big shears, and the
    other with the lawbrod; but it dodged them, and ran round about the
    fire; and one of the 'prentices, thinking to snap it with the shears,
    fell into the ashes. The tailor cast the goose, and the goodwife the
    tow-cards; but it wouldn't do. The bannock ran away, and ran till it
    came to a wee house at the roadside; and in it runs and there was a
    weaver sitting at the loom, and the wife winding a clue of yarn.</p>

    <p>"Tibby," quoth he, "what's that?"</p>
    <p>"Oh," quoth she, "it's a wee bannock."</p>
    <p>"It's well come," quoth he, "for our porrage were but thin to-day.
    Grip it, my woman; grip it."</p>
    <p>"Ay," quoth she; "what recks! That's a clever bannock. Catch it,
    Willie; catch it, man."</p>
    <p>"Hout," quoth Willie, "cast the clue at it."</p>
    <p>But the bannock dodged round about, and off it went, and over the
    hill, like a new-tarred sheep or a mad cow. And forward it runs to the
    neat-house, to the fireside; and there was the goodwife churning.</p>
    <p>"Come away, wee bannock," quoth she; "I'll have cream and bread
    to-day." But the wee bannock dodged round about the churn, and the
    wife after it, and in the hurry she had near-hand overturned the
    churn. And before she got it set right again, the wee bannock was off
    and down the brae to the mill; and in it ran.</p>
    <p>The miller was sifting meal in the trough; but, looking up: "Ay,"
    quoth he, "it's a sign of plenty when ye're running about, and nobody
    to look after ye. But I like a bannock and cheese. Come your way
    hither, and I'll give ye a night's quarters." But the bannock wouldn't
    trust itself with the miller and his cheese. So it turned and ran its
    way out; but the miller didn't fash his head with it.</p>
    <p>So it toddled away and ran till it came to the smithy; and in it
    runs, and up to the anvil. The smith was making horse-nails. Quoth he:
    "I like a glass of good ale and a well-toasted bannock. Come your way
    in by here." But the bannock was frightened when it heard about the
    ale, and turned and was off as hard as it could, and the smith after
    it, and cast the hammer. But it missed, and the bannock was out of
    sight in a crack, and ran till it came to a farmhouse with a good
    peat-stack at the end of it. Inside it runs to the fireside. The
    goodman was cloving lint, and the goodwife heckling. "O Janet," quoth
    he, "there's a wee bannock; I'll have the half of it."</p>
    <p>"Well, John, I'll have the other half. Hit it over the back with
    the clove." But the bannock played dodgings. "Hout, tout," quoth the
    wife, and made the heckle flee at it. But it was too clever for
    her.</p>
    <p>And off and up the burn it ran to the next house, and rolled its
    way to the fireside. The goodwife was stirring the soup, and the
    goodman plaiting sprit-binnings for the cows. "Ho, Jock," quoth the
    goodwife, "here come. You're always crying about a wee bannock. Here's
    one. Come in, haste ye, and I'll help ye to grip it."</p>
    <p>"Ay, mother, where is it?"</p>
    <p>"See there. Run over on that side."</p>
    <p>But the bannock ran in behind the goodman's chair. Jock fell among
    the sprits. The goodman cast a binning, and the goodwife the spurtle.
    But it was too clever for Jock and her both. It was off and out of
    sight in a crack, and through among the whins, and down the road to
    the next house, and in and snug by the fireside. The folk were just
    sitting down to their soup, and the goodwife scraping the pot. "Look,"
    quoth she, "there's a wee bannock come in to warm itself at our
    fireside."</p>
    <p>"Shut the door," quoth the goodman, "and we'll try to get a grip of
    it."</p>
    <p>When the bannock heard that, it ran out of the house and they after
    it with their spoons, and the goodman shied his hat. But it rolled
    away and ran, and ran, till it came to another house; and when it went
    in the folk were just going to their beds. The goodman was taking off
    his breeches, and the goodwife raking the fire.</p>
    <p>"What's that?" quoth he.</p>
    <p>"Oh," quoth she, "it's a wee bannock."</p>
    <p>Quoth he, "I could eat the half of it."</p>
    <p>"Grip it," quoth the wife, "and I'll have a bit too."</p>
    <p>"Cast your breeches at it!" The goodman shied his breeches, and had
    nearly smothered it. But it wriggled out and ran, and the goodman
    after it without his breeches; and there was a clean chase over the
    craft park, and in among the whins; and the goodman lost it, and had
    to come away, trotting home half naked. But now it was grown dark, and
    the wee bannock couldn't see; but it went into the side of a big whin
    bush, and into a fox's hole. The fox had had no meat for two days. "O
    welcome, welcome," quoth the fox, and snapped it in two in the middle.
    And that was the end of the wee bannock.</p>

    <h2>Johnny Gloke</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Johnny Gloke was a tailor by trade, but like a man of spirit he
    grew tired of his tailoring, and wished to follow some other path that
    would lead to honour and fame. But he did not know what to do at first
    to gain fame and fortune, so for a time he was fonder of basking idly
    in the sun than in plying the needle and scissors. One warm day as he
    was enjoying his ease, he was annoyed by the flies alighting on his
    bare ankles. He brought his hand down on them with force and killed a
    goodly number of them. On counting the victims of his valour, he was
    overjoyed at his success; his heart rose to the doing of great deeds,
    and he gave vent to his feelings in the saying:&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Well done! Johnny
    Gloke,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Kilt fifty flies at one
    stroke."</span><br />

    <p>His resolution was now taken to cut out his path to fortune and
    honour. So he took down from its resting-place a rusty old sword that
    had belonged to some of his forebears, and set out in search of
    adventures. After travelling a long way, he came to a country that was
    much troubled by two giants, whom no one was bold enough to meet, and
    strong enough to overcome. He was soon told of the giants, and learned
    that the King of the country had offered a great reward and the hand
    of his daughter in marriage to the man who should rid his land of this
    scourge. John's heart rose to the deed, and he offered himself for the
    service. The great haunt of the giants was a wood, and John set out
    with his old sword to perform his task. When he reached the wood, he
    laid himself down to think what course he would follow, for he knew
    how weak he was compared to those he had undertaken to kill. He had
    not waited long, when he saw them coming with a waggon to fetch wood
    for fuel. My! they were big ones, with huge heads and long tusks for
    teeth. Johnny hid himself in the hollow of a tree, thinking only of
    his own safety. Feeling himself safe, he peeped out of his
    hiding-place, and watched the two at work. Thus watching he formed his
    plan of action. He picked up a pebble, threw it with force at one of
    them, and struck him a sharp blow on the head. The giant in his pain
    turned at once on his companion, and blamed him in strong words for
    hitting him. The other denied in anger that he had thrown the pebble.
    John now saw himself on the high way to gain his reward and the hand
    of the King's daughter. He kept still, and carefully watched for an
    opportunity of striking another blow. He soon found it, and right
    against the giant's head went another pebble. The injured giant fell
    on his companion in fury, and the two belaboured each other till they
    were utterly tired out. They sat down on a log to breathe, rest, and
    recover themselves.</p>

      alt='"...the two belaboured each other till they were utterly tired out."'
       border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>While sitting, one of them said, "Well, all the King's army was not
    able to take us, but I fear an old woman with a rope's end would be
    too much for us now."</p>
    <p>"If that be so," said Johnny Gloke, as he sprang, bold as a lion,
    from his hiding-place, "What do you say to Johnny Gloke with his old
    roosty sword?" So saying he fell upon them, cut off their heads, and
    returned in triumph. He received the King's daughter in marriage and
    for a time lived in peace and happiness. He never told the mode he
    followed in his dealing with the giants.</p>
    <p>Some time after a rebellion broke out among the subjects of his
    father-in-law. John, on the strength of his former valiant deed, was
    chosen to quell the rebellion. His heart sank within him, but he could
    not refuse, and so lose his great name. He was mounted on the fiercest
    horse that ever saw sun or wind, and set out on his desperate task. He
    was not accustomed to ride on horseback, and he soon lost all control
    of his steed. It galloped off at full speed, in the direction of the
    rebel army. In its wild career it passed under the gallows that stood
    by the wayside. The gallows was somewhat old and frail, and down it
    fell on the horse's neck. Still the horse made no stop, but always
    forward at furious speed towards the rebels. On seeing this strange
    sight approaching towards them at such a speed they were seized with
    terror, and cried out to one another, "There comes Johnny Gloke that
    killed the two giants with the gallows on his horse's neck to hang us
    all." They broke their ranks, fled in dismay, and never stopped till
    they reached their homes. Thus was Johnny Gloke a second time
    victorious. So in due time he came to the throne and lived a long,
    happy, and good life as king.</p>

    <a id="Coat_o_Clay" name='Coat_o_Clay'></a>
    <h2>Coat o' Clay</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once on a time, in the parts of Lindsey, there lived a wise woman.
    Some said she was a witch, but they said it in a whisper, lest she
    should overhear and do them a mischief, and truly it was not a thing
    one could be sure of, for she was never known to hurt any one, which,
    if she were a witch, she would have been sure to do. But she could
    tell you what your sickness was, and how to cure it with herbs, and
    she could mix rare possets that would drive the pain out of you in a
    twinkling; and she could advise you what to do if your cows were ill,
    or if you'd got into trouble, and tell the maids whether their
    sweethearts were likely to be faithful.</p>
    <p>But she was ill-pleased if folks questioned her too much or too
    long, and she sore misliked fools. A many came to her asking foolish
    things, as was their nature, and to them she never gave
    counsel&mdash;at least of a kind that could aid them much.</p>
    <p>Well, one day, as she sat at her door paring potatoes, over the
    stile and up the path came a tall lad with a long nose and goggle eyes
    and his hands in his pockets.</p>
    <p>"That's a fool, if ever was one, and a fool's luck in his face,"
    said the wise woman to herself with a nod of her head, and threw a
    potato skin over her left shoulder to keep off ill-chance.</p>
    <p>"Good-day, missis," said the fool. "I be come to see thee."</p>
    <p>"So thou art," said the wise woman; "I see that. How's all in thy
    folk this year?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, fairly," answered he. "But they say I be a fool."</p>
    <p>"Ay, so thou art," nodded she, and threw away a bad potato. "I see
    that too. But wouldst o' me? I keep no brains for sale."</p>
    <p>"Well, see now. Mother says I'll ne'er be wiser all my born days;
    but folks tell us thou canst do everything. Can't thee teach me a bit,
    so they'll think me a clever fellow at home?"</p>
    <p>"Hout-tout!" said the wise woman; "thou 'rt a bigger fool than I
    thought. Nay, I can't teach thee nought, lad; but I tell thee summat.
    Thou 'lt be a fool all thy days till thou gets a coat o' clay; and
    then thou 'lt know more than me."</p>
    <p>"Hi, missis; what sort of a coat's that?" said he.</p>
    <p>"That's none o' my business," answered she, "Thou 'st got to find
    out that."</p>
    <p>And she took up her potatoes and went into her house.</p>
    <p>The fool took off his cap and scratched his head.</p>
    <p>"It's a queer kind of coat to look for, sure-<i>ly</i>," said he,
    "I never heard of a coat o' clay. But then I be a fool, that's
    true."</p>
    <p>So he walked on till he came to the drain near by, with just a
    pickle of water and a foot of mud in it.</p>
    <p>"Here's muck," said the fool, much pleased, and he got in and
    rolled in it spluttering. "Hi, yi!" said he&mdash;for he had his mouth
    full&mdash;"I've got a coat o' clay now to be sure. I'll go home and
    tell my mother I'm a wise man and not a fool any longer." And he went
    on home.</p>
    <p>Presently he came to a cottage with a lass at the door.</p>
    <p>"Morning, fool," said she; "hast thou been ducked in the
    horse-pond?"</p>
    <p>"Fool yourself," said he, "the wise woman says I'll know more 'n
    she when I get a coat o' clay, and here it is. Shall I marry thee,
    lass?"</p>
    <p>"Ay," said she, for she thought she'd like a fool for a husband,
    "when shall it be?"</p>
    <p>"I'll come and fetch thee when I've told my mother," said the fool,
    and he gave her his lucky penny and went on.</p>
    <p>When he got home his mother was on the doorstep.</p>
    <p>"Mother, I 've got a coat o' clay," said he.</p>
    <p>"Coat o' muck," said she; "and what of that?"</p>
    <p>"Wise woman said I'd know more than she when I got a coat o' clay,"
    said he, "so I down in the drain and got one, and I'm not a fool any
    longer."</p>
    <p>"Very good," said his mother, "now thou canst get a wife."</p>
    <p>"Ay," said he, "I'm going to marry so-an'-so."</p>
    <p>"What!" said his mother, "<i>that</i> lass? No, and that thou 'lt
    not. She's nought but a brat, with ne'er a cow or a cabbage o' her
    own."</p>
    <p>"But I gave her my luck penny," said the fool.</p>
    <p>"Then thou 'rt a bigger fool than ever, for all thy coat o' clay!"
    said his mother, and banged the door in his face.</p>
    <p>"Dang it!" said the fool, and scratched his head, "that's not the
    right sort o' clay sure-<i>ly</i>."</p>
    <p>So back he went to the highroad and sat down on the bank of the
    river close by, looking at the water, which was cool and clear.</p>
    <p>By-and-by he fell asleep, and before he knew what he was
    about&mdash;plump&mdash;he rolled off into the river with a splash,
    and scrambled out, dripping like a drowned rat.</p>
    <p>"Dear, dear," said he, "I'd better go and get dry in the sun." So
    up he went to the highroad, and lay down in the dust, rolling about so
    that the sun should get at him all over.</p>
    <p>Presently, when he sat up and looked down at himself, he found that
    the dust had caked into a sort of skin over his wet clothes till you
    could not see an inch of them, they were so well covered. "Hi, yi!"
    said he, "here's a coat o' clay ready made, and a fine one. See now,
    I'm a clever fellow this time sure-<i>ly</i>, for I've found what I
    wanted without looking for it! Wow, but it's a fine feeling to be so
    smart!"</p>
    <p>And he sat and scratched his head, and thought about his own
    cleverness.</p>
    <p>But all of a sudden, round the corner came the squire on horseback,
    full gallop, as if the boggles were after him; but the fool had to
    jump, even though the squire pulled his horse back on his
    haunches.</p>
    <p>"What the dickens," said the squire, "do you mean by lying in the
    middle of the road like that?"</p>
    <p>"Well, master," said the fool, "I fell into the water and got wet,
    so I lay down in the road to get dry; and I lay down a fool an' got up
    a wise man."</p>
    <p>"How's that?" said the squire.</p>
    <p>So the fool told him about the wise woman and the coat o' clay.</p>
    <p>"Ah, ah!" laughed the squire, "whoever heard of a wise man lying in
    the middle of the highroad to be ridden over? Lad, take my word for
    it, you are a bigger fool than ever," and he rode on laughing.</p>
    <p>"Dang it!" said the fool, as he scratched his head. "I've not got
    the right sort of coat yet, then." And he choked and spluttered in the
    dust that the squire's horse had raised.</p>
    <p>So on he went in a melancholy mood till he came to an inn, and the
    landlord at his door smoking.</p>
    <p>"Well, fool," said he, "thou 'rt fine and dirty."</p>
    <p>"Ay," said the fool, "I be dirty outside an' dusty in, but it's not
    the right thing yet."</p>
    <p>And he told the landlord all about the wise woman and the coat o'
    clay.</p>
    <p>"Hout-tout!" said the landlord, with a wink. "I know what's wrong.
    Thou 'st got a skin o' dirt outside and all dry dust inside. Thou must
    moisten it, lad, with a good drink, and then thou 'lt have a real
    all-over coat o' clay."</p>
    <p>"Hi," said the fool, "that's a good word."</p>
    <p>So down he sat and began to drink. But it was wonderful how much
    liquor it took to moisten so much dust; and each time he got to the
    bottom of the pot he found he was still dry. At last he began to feel
    very merry and pleased with himself.</p>
    <p>"Hi, yi!" said he. "I've got a real coat o' clay now outside and
    in&mdash;what a difference it do make, to be sure. I feel another man
    now&mdash;so smart."</p>
    <p>And he told the landlord he was certainly a wise man now, though he
    couldn't speak over-distinctly after drinking so much. So up he got,
    and thought he would go home and tell his mother she hadn't a fool for
    a son any more.</p>
    <p>But just as he was trying to get through the inn-door which would
    scarcely keep still long enough for him to find it, up came the
    landlord and caught him by the sleeve.</p>
    <img src='images/illus100.jpg' hspace='5' vspace='5' width='150'
    height='358' align='right'
    alt='"...I be dirty outside an&rsquo; dusty in..."' />
    <p>"See here, master," said he, "thou hasn't paid for thy
    score&mdash;where's thy money?"</p>
    <p>"Haven't any!" said the fool, and pulled out his pockets to show
    they were empty.</p>
    <p>"What!" said the landlord, and swore; "thou 'st drunk all my liquor
    and haven't got nought to pay for it with!"</p>
    <p>"Hi!" said the fool. "You told me to drink so as to get a coat o'
    clay; but as I'm a wise man now I don't mind helping thee along in the
    world a bit, for though I'm a smart fellow I'm not too proud to my
    friends."</p>
    <p>"Wise man! smart fellow!" said the landlord, "and help me along,
    wilt thee? Dang it! thou 'rt the biggest fool I ever saw, and it's
    I'll help <i>thee</i> first&mdash;out o' this!"</p>
    <p>And he kicked him out of the door into the road and swore at
    him.</p>
    <p>"Hum," said the fool, as he lay in the dust, "I'm not so wise as I
    thought. I guess I'll go back to the wise woman and tell her there's a
    screw loose somewhere."</p>
    <p>So up he got and went along to her house, and found her sitting at
    the door.</p>
    <p>"So thou 'rt come back," said she, with a nod. "What dost thou want
    with me now?"</p>
    <p>So he sat down and told her how he'd tried to get a coat o' clay,
    and he wasn't any wiser for all of it.</p>
    <p>"No," said the wise woman, "thou 'rt a bigger fool than ever, my
    lad."</p>
    <p>"So they all say," sighed the fool; "but where can I get the right
    sort of coat o' clay, then, missis?"</p>
    <p>"When thou 'rt done with this world, and thy folk put thee in the
    ground," said the wise woman. "That's the only coat o' clay as 'll
    make such as <i>thee</i> wise, lad. Born a fool, die a fool, and be a
    fool thy life long, and that's the truth!"</p>
    <p>And she went into the house and shut the door.</p>
    <p>"Dang it," said the fool. "I must tell my mother she was right
    after all, and that she'll never have a wise man for a son!"</p>
    <p>And he went off home.</p>

    <h2>The Three Cows</h2>
    <br />

    <p>There was a farmer, and he had three cows, fine fat beauties they
    were. One was called Facey, the other Diamond, and the third Beauty.
    One morning he went into his cowshed, and there he found Facey so thin
    that the wind would have blown her away. Her skin hung loose about
    her, all her flesh was gone, and she stared out of her great eyes as
    though she'd seen a ghost; and what was more, the fireplace in the
    kitchen was one great pile of wood-ash. Well, he was bothered with it;
    he could not see how all this had come about.</p>
    <p>Next morning his wife went out to the shed, and see! Diamond was
    for all the world as wisht a looking creature as Facey&mdash;nothing
    but a bag of bones, all the flesh gone, and half a rick of wood was
    gone too; but the fireplace was piled up three feet high with white
    wood-ashes. The farmer determined to watch the third night; so he hid
    in a closet which opened out of the parlour, and he left the door just
    ajar, that he might see what passed.</p>
    <p>Tick, tick, went the clock, and the farmer was nearly tired of
    waiting; he had to bite his little finger to keep himself awake, when
    suddenly the door of his house flew open, and in rushed maybe a
    thousand pixies, laughing and dancing and dragging at Beauty's halter
    till they had brought the cow into the middle of the room. The farmer
    really thought he should have died with fright, and so perhaps he
    would had not curiosity kept him alive.</p>
    <p>Tick, tick, went the clock, but he did not hear it now. He was too
    intent staring at the pixies and his last beautiful cow. He saw them
    throw her down, fall on her, and kill her; then with their knives they
    ripped her open, and flayed her as clean as a whistle. Then out ran
    some of the little people and brought in firewood and made a roaring
    blaze on the hearth, and there they cooked the flesh of the
    cow&mdash;they baked and they boiled, they stewed and they fried.</p>
    <p>"Take care," cried one, who seemed to be the king, "let no bone be
    broken."</p>
    <p>Well, when they had all eaten, and had devoured every scrap of beef
    on the cow, they began playing games with the bones, tossing them one
    to another. One little leg-bone fell close to the closet door, and the
    farmer was so afraid lest the pixies should come there and find him in
    their search for the bone, that he put out his hand and drew it in to
    him. Then he saw the king stand on the table and say, "Gather the
    bones!"</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus103.jpg' width='500' height='333'
      alt='"...they began playing games with the bones..."' border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>Round and round flew the imps, picking up the bones. "Arrange
    them," said the king; and they placed them all in their proper
    positions in the hide of the cow. Then they folded the skin over them,
    and the king struck the heap of bone and skin with his rod. Whisht! up
    sprang the cow and lowed dismally. It was alive again; but, alas! as
    the pixies dragged it back to its stall, it halted in the off
    forefoot, for a bone was missing.</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"The cock crew,</span><br />

    <h2>The Blinded Giant</h2>
    <br />

    <p>At Dalton, near Thirsk, in Yorkshire, there is a mill. It has quite
    recently been rebuilt; but when I was at Dalton, six years ago, the
    old building stood. In front of the house was a long mound which went
    by the name of "the giant's grave," and in the mill you can see a long
    blade of iron something like a scythe-blade, but not curved, which was
    called "the giant's knife," because of a very curious story which is
    told of this knife. Would you like to hear it? Well, it isn't very
    long.</p>
    <p>There once lived a giant at this mill who had only one eye in the
    middle of his forehead, and he ground men's bones to make his bread.
    One day he captured on Pilmoor a lad named Jack, and instead of
    grinding him in the mill he kept him grinding as his servant, and
    never let him get away. Jack served the giant seven years, and never
    was allowed a holiday the whole time. At last he could bear it no
    longer. Topcliffe fair was coming on, and Jack begged that he might be
    allowed to go there.</p>
    <p>"No, no," said the giant, "stop at home and mind your
    grinding."</p>
    <p>"I've been grinding and grinding these seven years," said Jack,
    "and not a holiday have I had. I'll have one now, whatever you
    say."</p>
    <p>"We'll see about that," said the giant.</p>
    <p>Well, the day was hot, and after dinner the giant lay down in the
    mill with his head on a sack and dozed. He had been eating in the
    mill, and had laid down a great loaf of bone bread by his side, and
    the knife I told you about was in his hand, but his fingers relaxed
    their hold of it in sleep. Jack seized the knife, and holding it with
    both his hands drove the blade into the single eye of the giant, who
    woke with a howl of agony, and starting up, barred the door. Jack was
    again in difficulties, for he couldn't get out, but he soon found a
    way out of them. The giant had a favourite dog, which had also been
    sleeping when his master was blinded. So Jack killed the dog, skinned
    it, and threw the hide over his back.</p>
    <p>"Bow, wow," says Jack.</p>
    <p>"At him, Truncheon," said the giant; "at the little wretch that
    I've fed these seven years, and now has blinded me."</p>
    <p>"Bow, wow," says Jack, and ran between the giant's legs on
    all-fours, barking till he got to the door. He unlatched it and was
    off, and never more was seen at Dalton Mill.</p>

    <h2>Scrapefoot</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time, there were three Bears who lived in a castle in a
    great wood. One of them was a great big Bear, and one was a middling
    Bear, and one was a little Bear. And in the same wood there was a Fox
    who lived all alone, his name was Scrapefoot. Scrapefoot was very much
    afraid of the Bears, but for all that he wanted very much to know all
    about them. And one day as he went through the wood he found himself
    near the Bears' Castle, and he wondered whether he could get into the
    castle. He looked all about him everywhere, and he could not see any
    one. So he came up very quietly, till at last he came up to the door
    of the castle, and he tried whether he could open it. Yes! the door
    was not locked, and he opened it just a little way, and put his nose
    in and looked, and he could not see any one. So then he opened it a
    little way farther, and put one paw in, and then another paw, and
    another and another, and then he was all in the Bears' Castle. He
    found he was in a great hall with three chairs in it&mdash;one big,
    one middling, and one little chair; and he thought he would like to
    sit down and rest and look about him; so he sat down on the big chair.
    But he found it so hard and uncomfortable that it made his bones ache,
    and he jumped down at once and got into the middling chair, and he
    turned round and round in it, but he couldn't make himself
    comfortable. So then he went to the little chair and sat down in it,
    and it was so soft and warm and comfortable that Scrapefoot was quite
    happy; but all at once it broke to pieces under him and he couldn't
    put it together again! So he got up and began to look about him again,
    and on one table he saw three saucers, of which one was very big, one
    was middling, one was quite a little saucer. Scrapefoot was very
    thirsty, and he began to drink out of the big saucer. But he only just
    tasted the milk in the big saucer, which was so sour and so nasty that
    he would not taste another drop of it. Then he tried the middling
    saucer, and he drank a little of that. He tried two or three
    mouthfuls, but it was not nice, and then he left it and went to the
    little saucer, and the milk in the little saucer was so sweet and so
    nice that he went on drinking it till it was all gone.</p>
    <p>Then Scrapefoot thought he would like to go upstairs; and he
    listened and he could not hear any one. So upstairs he went, and he
    found a great room with three beds in it; one was a big bed, and one
    was a middling bed, and one was a little white bed; and he climbed up
    into the big bed, but it was so hard and lumpy and uncomfortable that
    he jumped down again at once, and tried the middling bed. That was
    rather better, but he could not get comfortably in it, so after
    turning about a little while he got up and went to the little bed; and
    that was so soft and so warm and so nice that he fell fast asleep at
    once.</p>
    <p>And after a time the Bears came home, and when they got into the
    hall the big Bear went to his chair and said, "WHO'S BEEN SITTING IN
    MY CHAIR?" and the middling Bear said, "WHO'S BEEN SITTING IN MY
    CHAIR?" and the little Bear said, "<i>Who's been sitting in my chair
    and has broken it all to pieces?</i>" And then they went to have their
    milk, and the big Bear said, "WHO'S BEEN DRINKING MY MILK?" and the
    middling Bear said, "WHO'S BEEN DRINKING MY MILK?" and the little Bear
    said, "<i>Who's been drinking my milk and has drunk it all up?</i>"
    Then they went upstairs and into the bedroom, and the big Bear said,
    "WHO'S BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED?" and the middling Bear said, "WHO'S
    BEEN SLEEPING IN MY BED?" and the little Bear said, "<i>Who's been
    sleeping in my bed?&mdash;and see here he is!</i>" So then the Bears
    came and wondered what they should do with him; and the big Bear said,
    "Let's hang him!" and then the middling Bear said, "Let's drown him!"
    and then the little Bear said, "Let's throw him out of the window."
    And then the Bears took him to the window, and the big Bear took two
    legs on one side and the middling Bear took two legs on the other
    side, and they swung him backwards and forwards, backwards and
    forwards, and out of the window. Poor Scrapefoot was so frightened,
    and he thought every bone in his body must be broken. But he got up
    and first shook one leg&mdash;no, that was not broken; and then
    another, and that was not broken; and another and another, and then he
    wagged his tail and found there were no bones broken. So then he
    galloped off home as fast as he could go, and never went near the
    Bears' Castle again.</p>

    <h2>The Pedlar of Swaffham</h2>
    <br />

    <p>In the old days when London Bridge was lined with shops from one
    end to the other, and salmon swam under the arches, there lived at
    Swaffham, in Norfolk, a poor pedlar. He'd much ado to make his living,
    trudging about with his pack at his back and his dog at his heels, and
    at the close of the day's labour was but too glad to sit down and
    sleep. Now it fell out that one night he dreamed a dream, and therein
    he saw the great bridge of London town, and it sounded in his ears
    that if he went there he should hear joyful news. He made little count
    of the dream, but on the following night it come back to him, and
    again on the third night.</p>
    <p>Then he said within himself, "I must needs try the issue of it,"
    and so he trudged up to London town. Long was the way and right glad
    was he when he stood on the great bridge and saw the tall houses on
    right hand and left, and had glimpses of the water running and the
    ships sailing by. All day long he paced to and fro, but he heard
    nothing that might yield him comfort. And again on the morrow he stood
    and he gazed&mdash;he paced afresh the length of London Bridge, but
    naught did he see and naught did he hear.</p>
    <p>Now the third day being come as he still stood and gazed, a
    shopkeeper hard by spoke to him.</p>
    <p>"Friend," said he, "I wonder much at your fruitless standing. Have
    you no wares to sell?"</p>
    <p>"No, indeed," quoth the pedlar.</p>
    <p>"And you do not beg for alms."</p>
    <p>"Not so long as I can keep myself."</p>
    <p>"Then what, I pray thee, dost thou want here, and what may thy
    business be?"</p>
    <p>"Well, kind sir, to tell the truth, I dreamed that if I came
    hither, I should hear good news."</p>
    <p>Right heartily did the shopkeeper laugh.</p>
    <p>"Nay, thou must be a fool to take a journey on such a silly errand.
    I'll tell thee, poor silly country fellow, that I myself dream too o'
    nights, and that last night I dreamt myself to be in Swaffham, a place
    clean unknown to me, but in Norfolk if I mistake not, and methought I
    was in an orchard behind a pedlar's house, and in that orchard was a
    great oak-tree. Then meseemed that if I digged I should find beneath
    that tree a great treasure. But think you I'm such a fool as to take
    on me a long and wearisome journey and all for a silly dream. No, my
    good fellow, learn wit from a wiser man than thyself. Get thee home,
    and mind thy business."</p>
    <p>When the pedlar heard this he spoke no word, but was exceeding glad
    in himself, and returning home speedily, digged underneath the great
    oak-tree, and found a prodigious great treasure. He grew exceeding
    rich, but he did not forget his duty in the pride of his riches. For
    he built up again the church at Swaffham, and when he died they put a
    statue of him therein all in stone with his pack at his back and his
    dog at his heels. And there it stands to this day to witness if I
    lie.</p>

    <h2>The Old Witch</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time there were two girls who lived with their mother
    and father. Their father had no work, and the girls wanted to go away
    and seek their fortunes. Now one girl wanted to go to service, and her
    mother said she might if she could find a place. So she started for
    the town. Well, she went all about the town, but no one wanted a girl
    like her. So she went on farther into the country, and she came to the
    place where there was an oven where there was lots of bread baking.
    And the bread said, "Little girl, little girl, take us out, take us
    out. We have been baking seven years, and no one has come to take us
    out." So the girl took out the bread, laid it on the ground, and went
    on her way. Then she met a cow, and the cow said, "Little girl, little
    girl, milk me, milk me! Seven years have I been waiting, and no one
    has come to milk me." The girl milked the cow into the pails that
    stood by. As she was thirsty she drank some, and left the rest in the
    pails by the cow. Then she went on a little bit farther, and came to
    an apple tree, so loaded with fruit that its branches were breaking
    down, and the tree said, "Little girl, little girl, help me shake my
    fruit. My branches are breaking, it is so heavy." And the girl said,
    "Of course I will, you poor tree." So she shook the fruit all off,
    propped up the branches, and left the fruit on the ground under the
    tree. Then she went on again till she came to a house. Now in this
    house there lived a witch, and this witch took girls into her house as
    servants. And when she heard that this girl had left her home to seek
    service, she said that she would try her, and give her good wages. The
    witch told the girl what work she was to do. "You must keep the house
    clean and tidy, sweep the floor and the fireplace; but there is one
    thing you must never do. You must never look up the chimney, or
    something bad will befall you."</p>
    <p>So the girl promised to do as she was told, but one morning as she
    was cleaning, and the witch was out, she forgot what the witch said,
    and looked up the chimney. When she did this a great bag of money fell
    down in her lap. This happened again and again. So the girl started to
    go off home.</p>
    <p>When she had gone some way she heard the witch coming after her. So
    she ran to the apple tree and cried:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Apple-tree, apple-tree hide

     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So the old witch can't find

    bones,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And bury me under the marble

    <p>So the apple-tree hid her. When the witch came up she said:</p>

     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Who's stole my money, all I
    had?"</span><br />

    <p>And the apple-tree said, "No, mother; not for seven year."</p>
    <p>When the witch had gone down another way, the girl went on again,
    and just as she got to the cow heard the witch coming after her again,
    so she ran to the cow and cried:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Cow, cow, hide me,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So the old witch can't find

    <p>So the cow hid her.</p>
    <p>When the old witch came up, she looked about and said to the
    cow:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Cow of mine, cow of
    mine,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Have you seen a girl</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>With a willy-willy wag, and a
    long-tailed bag,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Who's stole my money, all I
    had?"</span><br />

    <p>And the cow said, "No, mother, not for seven year."</p>
    <p>When the witch had gone off another way, the little girl went on
    again, and when she was near the oven she heard the witch coming after
    her again, so she ran to the oven and cried:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Oven, oven, hide me,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So the old witch can't find
    me;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>If she does she'll break my
    bones,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And bury me under the marble
    stones."</span><br />

    <p>And the oven said, "I've no room, ask the baker," and the baker hid
    her behind the oven.</p>
    <p>When the witch came up she looked here and there and everywhere,
    and then said to the baker:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Man of mine, man of
    mine,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Have you seen a girl,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>With a willy-willy wag, and a
    long-tailed bag,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Who's stole my money, all I
    had?"</span><br />

    <p>So the baker said, "Look in the oven." The old witch went to look,
    and the oven said, "Get in and look in the furthest corner." The witch
    did so, and when she was inside the oven shut her door, and the witch
    was kept there for a very long time.</p>
    <p>The girl then went off again, and reached her home with her money
    bags, married a rich man, and lived happy ever afterwards.</p>
    <p>The other sister then thought she would go and do the same. And she
    went the same way. But when she reached the oven, and the bread said,
    "Little girl, little girl, take us out. Seven years have we been
    baking, and no one has come to take us out," the girl said, "No, I
    don't want to burn my fingers." So she went on till she met the cow,
    and the cow said, "Little girl, little girl, milk me, milk me, do.
    Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to milk me." But
    the girl said, "No, I can't milk you, I'm in a hurry," and went on
    faster. Then she came to the apple-tree, and the apple-tree asked her
    to help shake the fruit. "No, I can't; another day p'raps I may," and
    went on till she came to the witch's house. Well, it happened to her
    just the same as to the other girl&mdash;she forgot what she was told,
    and one day when the witch was out, looked up the chimney, and down
    fell a bag of money. Well, she thought she would be off at once. When
    she reached the apple-tree, she heard the witch coming after her, and
    she cried:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Apple-tree, apple-tree, hide
    me,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So the old witch can't find

    bones,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And bury me under the marble
    stones."</span><br />

    <p>But the tree didn't answer, and she ran on further. Presently the
    witch came up and said:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Tree of mine, tree of
    mine,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Have you seen a girl,</span><br />

    had?"</span><br />

    <p>The tree said, "Yes, mother; she's gone down that way."</p>
    <p>So the old witch went after her and caught her, she took all the
    money away from her, beat her, and sent her off home just as she
    was.</p>

    <h2>The Three Wishes</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time, and be sure 't was a long time ago, there lived a
    poor woodman in a great forest, and every day of his life he went out
    to fell timber. So one day he started out, and the goodwife filled his
    wallet and slung his bottle on his back, that he might have meat and
    drink in the forest. He had marked out a huge old oak, which, thought
    he, would furnish many and many a good plank. And when he was come to
    it, he took his axe in his hand and swung it round his head as though
    he were minded to fell the tree at one stroke. But he hadn't given one
    blow, when what should he hear but the pitifullest entreating, and
    there stood before him a fairy who prayed and beseeched him to spare
    the tree. He was dazed, as you may fancy, with wonderment and
    affright, and he couldn't open his mouth to utter a word. But he found
    his tongue at last, and, "Well," said he, "I'll e'en do as thou
    wishest."</p>
    <p>"You've done better for yourself than you know," answered the
    fairy, "and to show I'm not ungrateful, I'll grant you your next three
    wishes, be they what they may." And therewith the fairy was no more to
    be seen, and the woodman slung his wallet over his shoulder and his
    bottle at his side, and off he started home.</p>
    <p>But the way was long, and the poor man was regularly dazed with the
    wonderful thing that had befallen him, and when he got home there was
    nothing in his noddle but the wish to sit down and rest. Maybe, too,
    't was a trick of the fairy's. Who can tell? Anyhow down he sat by the
    blazing fire, and as he sat he waxed hungry, though it was a long way
    off supper-time yet.</p>
    <p>"Hasn't thou naught for supper, dame?" said he to his wife.</p>
    <p>"Nay, not for a couple of hours yet," said she.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" groaned the woodman, "I wish I'd a good link of black pudding
    here before me."</p>
    <p>No sooner had he said the word, when clatter, clatter, rustle,
    rustle, what should come down the chimney but a link of the finest
    black pudding the heart of man could wish for.</p>
    <p>If the woodman stared, the goodwife stared three times as much.
    "What's all this?" says she.</p>
    <p>Then all the morning's work came back to the woodman, and he told
    his tale right out, from beginning to end, and as he told it the
    goodwife glowered and glowered, and when he had made an end of it she
    burst out, "Thou bee'st but a fool, Jan, thou bee'st but a fool; and I
    wish the pudding were at thy nose, I do indeed."</p>
    <p>And before you could say Jack Robinson, there the goodman sat and
    his nose was the longer for a noble link of black pudding.</p>
    <p>He gave a pull but it stuck, and she gave a pull but it stuck, and
    they both pulled till they had nigh pulled the nose off, but it stuck
    and stuck.</p>
    <p>"What's to be done now?" said he.</p>
    <p>"'T isn't so very unsightly," said she, looking hard at him.</p>
    <p>Then the woodman saw that if he wished, he must need wish in a
    hurry; and wish he did, that the black pudding might come off his
    nose. Well! there it lay in a dish on the table, and if the goodman
    and goodwife didn't ride in a golden coach, or dress in silk and
    satin, why, they had at least as fine a black pudding for their supper
    as the heart of man could desire.</p>

    <h2>The Buried Moon</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Long ago, in my grandmother's time, the Carland was all in bogs,
    great pools of black water, and creeping trickles of green water, and
    squishy mools which squirted when you stepped on them.</p>
    <p>Well, granny used to say how long before her time the Moon herself
    was once dead and buried in the marshes, and as she used to tell me,
    I'll tell you all about it.</p>
    <p>The Moon up yonder shone and shone, just as she does now, and when
    she shone she lighted up the bog-pools, so that one could walk about
    almost as safe as in the day.</p>
    <p>But when she didn't shine, out came the Things that dwelt in the
    darkness and went about seeking to do evil and harm; Bogles and
    Crawling Horrors, all came out when the Moon didn't shine.</p>
    <p>Well, the Moon heard of this, and being kind and good&mdash;as she
    surely is, shining for us in the night instead of taking her natural
    rest&mdash;she was main troubled. "I'll see for myself, I will," said
    she, "maybe it's not so bad as folks make out."</p>
    <p>Sure enough, at the month's end down she stept, wrapped up in a
    black cloak, and a black hood over her yellow shining hair. Straight
    she went to the bog edge and looked about her. Water here and water
    there; waving tussocks and trembling mools, and great black snags all
    twisted and bent. Before her all was dark&mdash;dark but for the
    glimmer of the stars in the pools, and the light that came from her
    own white feet, stealing out of her black cloak.</p>
    <p>The Moon drew her cloak faster about and trembled, but she wouldn't
    go back without seeing all there was to be seen; so on she went,
    stepping as light as the wind in summer from tuft to tuft between the
    greedy gurgling water holes. Just as she came near a big black pool
    her foot slipped and she was nigh tumbling in. She grabbed with both
    hands at a snag near by to steady herself with, but as she touched it,
    it twined itself round her wrists, like a pair of handcuffs, and gript
    her so that she couldn't move. She pulled and twisted and fought, but
    it was no good. She was fast, and must stay fast.</p>
    <p>Presently as she stood trembling in the dark, wondering if help
    would come, she heard something calling in the distance, calling,
    calling, and then dying away with a sob, till the marshes were full of
    this pitiful crying sound; then she heard steps floundering along,
    squishing in the mud and slipping on the tufts, and through the
    darkness she saw a white face with great feared eyes.</p>
    <p>'T was a man strayed in the bogs. Mazed with fear he struggled on
    toward the flickering light that looked like help and safety. And when
    the poor Moon saw that he was coming nigher and nigher to the deep
    hole, further and further from the path, she was so mad and so sorry
    that she struggled and fought and pulled harder than ever. And though
    she couldn't get loose, she twisted and turned, till her black hood
    fell back off her shining yellow hair, and the beautiful light that
    came from it drove away the darkness.</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus125.jpg' width='451' height='350'
      alt='"...though she couldn&rsquo;t get loose, she twisted and turned..."'
       border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>Oh, but the man cried with joy to see the light again. And at once
    all evil things fled back into the dark corners, for they cannot abide
    the light. So he could see where he was, and where the path was, and
    how he could get out of the marsh. And he was in such haste to get
    away from the Quicks, and Bogles, and Things that dwelt there, that he
    scarce looked at the brave light that came from the beautiful shining
    yellow hair, streaming out over the black cloak and falling to the
    water at his feet. And the Moon herself was so taken up with saving
    him, and with rejoicing that he was back on the right path, that she
    clean forgot that she needed help herself, and that she was held fast
    by the Black Snag.</p>
    <p>So off he went; spent and gasping, and stumbling and sobbing with
    joy, flying for his life out of the terrible bogs. Then it came over
    the Moon, she would main like to go with him. So she pulled and fought
    as if she were mad, till she fell on her knees, spent with tugging, at
    the foot of the snag. And as she lay there, gasping for breath, the
    black hood fell forward over her head. So out went the blessed light
    and back came the darkness, with all its Evil Things, with a screech
    and a howl. They came crowding round her, mocking and snatching and
    beating; shrieking with rage and spite, and swearing and snarling, for
    they knew her for their old enemy, that drove them back into the
    corners, and kept them from working their wicked wills.</p>
    <p>"Drat thee!" yelled the witch-bodies, "thou 'st spoiled our spells
    this year agone!"</p>
    <p>"And us thou sent'st to brood in the corners!" howled the
    Bogles.</p>
    <p>And all the Things joined in with a great "Ho, ho!" till the very
    tussocks shook and the water gurgled. And they began again.</p>
    <p>"We'll poison her&mdash;poison her!" shrieked the witches.</p>
    <p>And "Ho, ho!" howled the Things again.</p>
    <p>"We'll smother her&mdash;smother her!" whispered the Crawling
    Horrors, and twined themselves round her knees.</p>
    <p>And "Ho, ho!" mocked the rest of them.</p>
    <p>And again they all shouted with spite and ill-will. And the poor
    Moon crouched down, and wished she was dead and done with.</p>
    <p>And they fought and squabbled what they should do with her, till a
    pale grey light began to come in the sky; and it drew nigh the
    dawning. And when they saw that, they were feared lest they shouldn't
    have time to work their will; and they caught hold of her, with horrid
    bony fingers, and laid her deep in the water at the foot of the snag.
    And the Bogles fetched a strange big stone and rolled it on top of
    her, to keep her from rising. And they told two of the
    Will-o-the-wykes to take turns in watching on the black snag, to see
    that she lay safe and still, and couldn't get out to spoil their
    sport.</p>
    <p>And there lay the poor Moon, dead and buried in the bog, till some
    one would set her loose; and who'd know where to look for her.</p>
    <p>Well, the days passed, and 't was the time for the new moon's
    coming, and the folk put pennies in their pockets and straws in their
    caps so as to be ready for her, and looked about, for the Moon was a
    good friend to the marsh folk, and they were main glad when the dark
    time was gone, and the paths were safe again, and the Evil Things were
    driven back by the blessed Light into the darkness and the
    waterholes.</p>
    <p>But days and days passed, and the new Moon never came, and the
    nights were aye dark, and the Evil Things were worse than ever. And
    still the days went on, and the new Moon never came. Naturally the
    poor folk were strangely feared and mazed, and a lot of them went to
    the Wise Woman who dwelt in the old mill, and asked if so be she could
    find out where the Moon was gone.</p>
    <p>"Well," said she, after looking in the brewpot, and in the mirror,
    and in the Book, "it be main queer, but I can't rightly tell ye what's
    happened to her. If ye hear of aught, come and tell me."</p>
    <p>So they went their ways; and as days went by, and never a Moon
    came, naturally they talked&mdash;my word! I reckon they <i>did</i>
    talk! their tongues wagged at home, and at the inn, and in the garth.
    But so came one day, as they sat on the great settle in the Inn, a man
    from the far end of the bog lands was smoking and listening, when all
    at once he sat up and slapped his knee. "My faicks!" says he, "I'd
    clean forgot, but I reckon I kens where the Moon be!" and he told them
    of how he was lost in the bogs, and how, when he was nigh dead with
    fright, the light shone out, and he found the path and got home
    safe.</p>
    <p>So off they all went to the Wise Woman, and told her about it, and
    she looked long in the pot and the Book again, and then she nodded her
    head.</p>
    <p>"It's dark still, childer, dark!" says she, "and I can't rightly
    see, but do as I tell ye, and ye 'll find out for yourselves. Go all
    of ye, just afore the night gathers, put a stone in your mouth, and
    take a hazel-twig in your hands, and say never a word till you're safe
    home again. Then walk on and fear not, far into the midst of the
    marsh, till ye find a coffin, a candle, and a cross. Then ye'll not be
    far from your Moon; look, and m'appen ye 'll find her."</p>
    <p>So came the next night in the darklings, out they went all
    together, every man with a stone in his mouth, and a hazel-twig in his
    hand, and feeling, thou may'st reckon, main feared and creepy. And
    they stumbled and stottered along the paths into the midst of the
    bogs; they saw nought, though they heard sighings and flutterings in
    their ears, and felt cold wet fingers touching them; but all at once,
    looking around for the coffin, the candle, and the cross, while they
    came nigh to the pool beside the great snag, where the Moon lay
    buried. And all at once they stopped, quaking and mazed and skeery,
    for there was the great stone, half in, half out of the water, for all
    the world like a strange big coffin; and at the head was the black
    snag, stretching out its two arms in a dark gruesome cross, and on it
    a tiddy light flickered, like a dying candle. And they all knelt down
    in the mud, and said, "Our Lord, first forward, because of the cross,
    and then backward, to keep off the Bogles; but without speaking out,
    for they knew that the Evil Things would catch them, if they didn't do
    as the Wise Woman told them."</p>
    <p>Then they went nigher, and took hold of the big stone, and shoved
    it up, and afterwards they said that for one tiddy minute they saw a
    strange and beautiful face looking up at them glad-like out of the
    black water; but the Light came so quick and so white and shining,
    that they stept back mazed with it, and the very next minute, when
    they could see again, there was the full Moon in the sky, bright and
    beautiful and kind as ever, shining and smiling down at them, and
    making the bogs and the paths as clear as day, and stealing into the
    very corners, as though she'd have driven the darkness and the Bogles
    clean away if she could.</p>

    <h2>A Son of Adam</h2>
    <br />

    <p>A man was one day working. It was very hot, and he was digging.
    By-and-by he stopped to rest and wipe his face; and he was very angry
    to think he had to work so hard only because of Adam's sin. So he
    complained bitterly, and said some very hard words about Adam.</p>
    <p>It happened that his master heard him, and he asked, "Why do you
    blame Adam? You'd ha' done just like Adam, if you'd a-been in his
    place."</p>
    <p>"No, I shouldn't," said the man; "I should ha' know'd better."</p>
    <p>"Well, I'll try you," says his master; "come to me at
    dinner-time."</p>
    <p>So come dinner-time, the man came, and his master took him into a
    room where the table was a-set with good things of all sorts. And he
    said: "Now, you can eat as much as ever you like from any of the
    dishes on the table; but don't touch the covered dish in the middle
    till I come back." And with that the master went out of the room and
    left the man there all by himself.</p>
    <p>So the man sat down and helped himself, and ate some o' this dish
    and some o' that, and enjoyed himself finely. But after awhile, as his
    master didn't come back, he began to look at the covered dish, and to
    wonder whatever was in it. And he wondered more and more, and he says
    to himself, "It must be something very nice. Why shouldn't I just look
    at it? I won't touch it. There can't be any harm in just peeping." So
    at last he could hold back no longer, and he lifted up the cover a
    tiny bit; but he couldn't see anything. Then he lifted it up a bit
    more, and out popped a mouse. The man tried to catch it; but it ran
    away and jumped off the table and he ran after it. It ran first into
    one corner, and then, just as he thought he'd got it, into another,
    and under the table, and all about the room. And the man made such a
    clatter, jumping and banging and running round after the mouse,
    a-trying to catch it, that at last his master came in.</p>
    <p>"Ah!" he said; "never you blame Adam again, my man!"</p>

     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>And look they did not

     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>And two long miles he led them
    on,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>While they for food
    complain:</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Stay here," quoth he, "I'll bring

     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>These pretty babes, with hand in

     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Went wandering up and

     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>They sat them down and

     <br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Thus wandered these poor

    <h2>The Hobyahs</h2>

    <p>Once there was an old man and woman and a little girl, and they all
    lived in a house made of hempstalks. Now the old man had a little dog
    named Turpie; and one night the Hobyahs came and said, "Hobyah!
    Hobyah! Hobyah! Tear down the hempstalks, eat up the old man and
    woman, and carry off the little girl!" But little dog Turpie barked so
    that the Hobyahs ran off; and the old man said, "Little dog Turpie
    barks so that I cannot sleep nor slumber, and if I live till morning I
    will cut off his tail." So in the morning the old man cut off little
    dog Turpie's tail.</p>

    <h2>A Pottle o' Brains</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once in these parts, and not so long gone neither, there was a fool
    that wanted to buy a pottle o' brains, for he was ever getting into
    scrapes through his foolishness, and being laughed at by every one.
    Folk told him that he could get everything he liked from the wise
    woman that lived on the top o' the hill, and dealt in potions and
    herbs and spells and things, and could tell thee! all as 'd come to
    thee or thy folk. So he told his mother, and asked her if he could
    seek the wise woman and buy a pottle o' brains.</p>
    <p>"That ye should," says she; "thou 'st sore need o' them, my son:
    and if I should die, who'd take care o' a poor fool such 's thou, no
    more fit to look after thyself than an unborn baby? but mind thy
    manners, and speak her pretty, my lad; for they wise folk are gey and
    light mispleased."</p>
    <p>So off he went after his tea, and there she was, sitting by the
    fire, and stirring a big pot.</p>
    <img src='images/illus147.jpg' vspace='5' hspace='5' width='200'
    height='148' align='right' alt='(Hobyah!)' border='0' />
    <p>"Good e'en, missis," says he, "it's a fine night."</p>
    <p>"Aye," says she, and went on stirring.</p>
    <p>"It'll maybe rain," says he, and fidgeted from one foot to t'
    other.</p>
    <p>"Maybe," says she.</p>
    <p>"And m'appen it won't," says he, and looked out o' the window.</p>
    <p>"M'appen," says she.</p>
    <p>And he scratched his head and twisted his hat.</p>
    <p>"Well," says he, "I can't mind nothing else about the weather, but
    let me see; the crops are getting on fine."</p>
    <p>"Fine," says she.</p>
    <p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;the beasts is fattening," says he.</p>
    <p>"They are," says she.</p>
    <p>"And&mdash;and&mdash;" says he, and comes to a stop&mdash;"I reckon
    we'll tackle business now, having done the polite like. Have you any
    brains for to sell?"</p>
    <p>"That depends," says she, "if thou wants king's brains, or
    soldier's brains, or schoolmaster's brains, I dinna keep 'em."</p>
    <p>"Hout no," says he, "jist ordinary brains&mdash;fit for any
    fool&mdash;same as every one has about here; something clean
    common-like."</p>
    <p>"Aye so," says the wise woman, "I might manage that, if so be thou
    'lt help thyself."</p>
    <p>"How's that for, missis?" says he.</p>
    <p>"Jest so," says she, looking in the pot; "bring me the heart of the
    thing thou likest best of all, and I'll tell thee where to get thy
    pottle o' brains."</p>
    <p>"But," says he, scratching his head, "how can I do that?"</p>
    <p>"That's no for me to say," says she, "find out for thyself, my lad!
    if thou doesn't want to be a fool all thy days. But thou 'll have to
    read me a riddle so as I can see thou 'st brought the right thing, and
    if thy brains is about thee. And I've something else to see to," says
    she, "so gode'en to thee," and she carried the pot away with her into
    the back place.</p>
    <p>So off went the fool to his mother, and told her what the wise
    woman said.</p>
    <p>"And I reckon I'll have to kill that pig," says he, "for I like fat
    bacon better than anything."</p>
    <p>"Then do it, my lad," said his mother, "for certain 't will be a
    strange and good thing fur thee, if thou canst buy a pottle o' brains,
    and be able to look after thy own self."</p>
    <p>So he killed his pig, and next day off he went to the wise woman's
    cottage, and there she sat, reading in a great book.</p>
    <p>"Gode'en, missis," says he, "I've brought thee the heart o' the
    thing I like the best of all; and I put it hapt in paper on the
    table."</p>
    <p>"Aye so?" says she, and looked at him through her spectacles. "Tell
    me this then, what runs without feet?"</p>
    <p>He scratched his head, and thought, and thought, but he couldn't
    tell.</p>
    <p>"Go thy ways," says she, "thou 'st not fetched me the right thing
    yet. I've no brains for thee to-day." And she clapt the book together,
    and turned her back.</p>
    <p>So off the fool went to tell his mother. But as he got nigh the
    house, out came folk running to tell him that his mother was
    dying.</p>
    <p>And when he got in, his mother only looked at him and smiled as if
    to say she could leave him with a quiet mind since he had got brains
    enough now to look after himself&mdash;and then she died.</p>
    <p>So down he sat and the more he thought about it the badder he felt.
    He minded how she'd nursed him when he was a tiddy brat, and helped
    him with his lessons, and cooked his dinners, and mended his clouts,
    and bore with his foolishness; and he felt sorrier and sorrier, while
    he began to sob and greet.</p>
    <p>"Oh, mother, mother!" says he, "who'll take care of me now? Thou
    shouldn't have left me alone, for I liked thee better than
    everything!"</p>
    <p>And as he said that, he thought of the words of the wise woman.
    "Hi, yi!" says he, "must I take mother's heart to her?"</p>
    <p>"No! I can't do that," says he. "What'll I do? what'll I do to get
    that pottle o' brains, now I'm alone in the world?" So he thought and
    thought and thought, and next day he went and borrowed a sack, and
    bundled his mother in, and carried it on his shoulder up to the wise
    woman's cottage.</p>
    <p>"Gode'en, missis," says he, "I reckon I've fetched thee the right
    thing this time, surely," and he plumped the sack down kerflap! in the
    doorsill.</p>
    <p>"Maybe," says the wise woman, "but read me this, now, what's yellow
    and shining but isn't gold?"</p>
    <p>And he scratched his head, and thought and thought, but he couldn't
    tell.</p>
    <p>"Thou 'st not hit the right thing, my lad," says she. "I doubt thou
    'rt a bigger fool than I thought!" and shut the door in his face.</p>
    <p>"See there!" says he, and set down by the road side and greets.</p>
    <p>"I've lost the only two things as I cared for, and what else can I
    find to buy a pottle o' brains with!" and he fair howled, till the
    tears ran down into his mouth. And up came a lass that lived near at
    hand, and looked at him.</p>
    <p>"What's up with thee, fool?" says she.</p>
    <p>"Oo, I've killed my pig, and lost my mother and I'm nobbut a fool
    myself," says he, sobbing.</p>
    <p>"That's bad," says she; "and haven't thee anybody to look after
    thee?"</p>
    <p>"No," says he, "and I canna buy my pottle o' brains, for there's
    nothing I like best left!"</p>
    <p>"What art talking about?" says she.</p>
    <p>And down she sets by him, and he told her all about the wise woman
    and the pig, and his mother and the riddles, and that he was alone in
    the world.</p>
    <p>"Well," says she, "I wouldn't mind looking after thee myself."</p>
    <p>"Could thee do it?" says he.</p>
    <p>"Ou, ay!" says she; "folks say as fools make good husbands, and I
    reckon I'll have thee, if thou 'rt willing."</p>
    <p>"Can'st cook?" says he.</p>
    <p>"Ay, I can," says she.</p>
    <p>"And scrub?" says he.</p>
    <p>"Surely," says she.</p>
    <p>"And mend my clouts?" says he.</p>
    <p>"I can that," says she.</p>
    <p>"I reckon thou 'lt do then as well as anybody," says he; "but
    what'll I do about this wise woman?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, wait a bit," says she, "something may turn up, and it'll not
    matter if thou 'rt a fool, so long'st thou 'st got me to look after
    thee."</p>
    <p>"That's true," says he, and off they went and got married. And she
    kept his house so clean and neat, and cooked his dinner so fine, that
    one night he says to her: "Lass, I'm thinking I like thee best of
    everything after all."</p>
    <p>"That's good hearing," says she, "and what then?"</p>
    <p>"Have I got to kill thee, dost think, and take thy heart up to the
    wise woman for that pottle o' brains?"</p>
    <p>"Law, no!" says she, looking skeered, "I winna have that. But see
    here; thou didn't cut out thy mother's heart, did thou?"</p>
    <p>"No; but if I had, maybe I'd have got my pottle o' brains," says
    he.</p>
    <p>"Not a bit of it," says she; "just thou take me as I be, heart and
    all, and I'll wager I'll help thee read the riddles."</p>
    <p>"Can thee so?" says he, doubtful like; "I reckon they're too hard
    for women folk."</p>
    <p>"Well," says she, "let's see now. Tell me the first"</p>
    <p>"What runs without feet?" says he.</p>
    <p>"Why, water!" says she.</p>
    <p>"It do," says he, and scratched his head.</p>
    <p>"And what's yellow and shining but isn't gold?"</p>
    <p>"Why, the sun!" says she.</p>
    <p>"Faith, it be!" says he. "Come, we'll go up to the wise woman at
    once," and off they went. And as they came up the pad, she was sitting
    at the door, twining straws.</p>
    <img src='images/illus153.jpg' width='300' height='386' align='right'
    alt='The Wise Woman' border='0' />
    <p>"Gode'en, missis," says he.</p>
    <p>"Gode'en, fool," says she.</p>
    <p>"I reckon I've fetched thee the right thing at last," says he.</p>
    <p>The wise woman looked at them both, and wiped her spectacles.</p>
    <p>"Canst tell me what that is as has first no legs, and then two
    legs, and ends with four legs?"</p>
    <p>And the fool scratched his head and thought and thought, but he
    couldn't tell.</p>
    <p>And the lass whispered in his ear:</p>
    <p>"It's a tadpole."</p>
    <p>"M'appen," says he then, "it may be a tadpole, missis."</p>
    <p>The wise woman nodded her head.</p>
    <p>"That's right," says she, "and thou 'st got thy pottle o' brains
    already."</p>
    <p>"Where be they?" says he, looking about and feeling in his
    pockets.</p>
    <p>"In thy wife's head," says she. "The only cure for a fool is a good
    wife to look after him, and that thou 'st got, so gode'en to thee!"
    And with that she nodded to them, and up and into the house.</p>
    <p>So they went home together, and he never wanted to buy a pottle o'
    brains again, for his wife had enough for both.</p>

    <h2>The King of England and His Three Sons</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time there was an old king who had three sons; and the
    old king fell very sick one time and there was nothing at all could
    make him well but some golden apples from a far country. So the three
    brothers went on horseback to look for some of these apples. They set
    off together, and when they came to cross-roads they halted and
    refreshed themselves a bit; and then they agreed to meet on a certain
    time, and not one was to go home before the other. So Valentine took
    the right, and Oliver went straight on, and poor Jack took the
    left.</p>
    <p>To make my long story short, I shall follow poor Jack, and let the
    other two take their chance, for I don't think there was much good in
    them. Off poor Jack rides over hills, dales, valleys, and mountains,
    through woolly woods and sheepwalks, where the old chap never sounded
    his hollow bugle-horn, farther than I can tell you to-night or ever
    intend to tell you.</p>
    <p>At last he came to an old house, near a great forest, and there was
    an old man sitting out by the door, and his look was enough to
    frighten you or any one else; and the old man said to him:</p>
    <p>"Good morning, my king's son."</p>
    <p>"Good morning to you, old gentleman," was the young prince's
    answer; frightened out of his wits though he was, he didn't like to
    give in.</p>
    <p>The old gentleman told him to dismount and to go in to have some
    refreshment, and to put his horse in the stable, such as it was. Jack
    soon felt much better after having something to eat, and began to ask
    the old gentleman how he knew he was a king's son.</p>
    <p>"Oh dear!" said the old man, "I knew that you were a king's son,
    and I know what is your business better than what you do yourself. So
    you will have to stay here to-night; and when you are in bed you
    mustn't be frightened whatever you may hear. There will come all
    manner of frogs and snakes, and some will try to get into your eyes
    and your mouth, but mind, don't stir the least bit or you will turn
    into one of those things yourself."</p>
    <p>Poor Jack didn't know what to make of this, but, however, he
    ventured to go to bed. Just as he thought to have a bit of sleep,
    round and over and under him they came, but he never stirred an inch
    all night.</p>
    <p>"Well, my young son, how are you this morning?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I am very well, thank you, but I didn't have much rest."</p>
    <p>"Well, never mind that; you have got on very well so far, but you
    have a great deal to go through before you can have the golden apples
    to go to your father. You'd better come and have some breakfast before
    you start on your way to my other brother's house. You will have to
    leave your own horse here with me until you come back again, and tell
    me everything about how you get on."</p>
    <p>After that out came a fresh horse for the young prince, and the old
    man gave him a ball of yarn, and he flung it between the horse's two
    ears.</p>
    <p>Off he went as fast as the wind, which the wind behind could not
    catch the wind before, until he came to the second oldest brother's
    house. When he rode up to the door he had the same salute as from the
    first old man, but this one was even uglier than the first one. He had
    long grey hair, and his teeth were curling out of his mouth, and his
    finger- and toe-nails had not been cut for many thousand years. He put
    the horse into a much better stable, and called Jack in, and gave him
    plenty to eat and drink, and they had a bit of a chat before they went
    to bed.</p>
    <p>"Well, my young son," said the old man, "I suppose you are one of
    the king's children come to look for the golden apples to bring him
    back to health."</p>
    <p>"Yes, I am the youngest of the three brothers, and I should like to
    get them to go back with."</p>
    <p>"Well, don't mind, my young son. Before you go to bed to-night I
    will send to my eldest brother, and will tell him what you want, and
    he won't have much trouble in sending you on to the place where you
    must get the apples. But mind not to stir to-night no matter how you
    get bitten and stung, or else you will work great mischief to
    yourself."</p>
    <p>The young man went to bed and bore all, as he did the first night,
    and got up the next morning well and hearty. After a good breakfast
    out comes a fresh horse, and a ball of yarn to throw between his ears.
    The old man told him to jump up quick, and said that he had made it
    all right with his eldest brother, not to delay for anything whatever,
    "For," said he, "you have a good deal to go through with in a very
    short and quick time."</p>
    <p>He flung the ball, and off he goes as quick as lightning, and comes
    to the eldest brother's house. The old man receives him very kindly
    and told him he long wished to see him, and that he would go through
    his work like a man and come back safe and sound. "To-night," said he,
    "I will give you rest; there shall nothing come to disturb you, so
    that you may not feel sleepy for to-morrow. And you must mind to get
    up middling early, for you've got to go and come all in the same day;
    there will be no place for you to rest within thousands of miles of
    that place; and if there was, you would stand in great danger never to
    come from there in your own form. Now, my young prince, mind what I
    tell you. To-morrow, when you come in sight of a very large castle,
    which will be surrounded with black water, the first thing you will do
    you will tie your horse to a tree, and you will see three beautiful
    swans in sight, and you will say, 'Swan, swan, carry me over in the
    name of the Griffin of the Greenwood,' and the swans will swim you
    over to the earth. There will be three great entrances, the first
    guarded by four great giants with drawn swords in their hands, the
    second by lions, the other by fiery serpents and dragons. You will
    have to be there exactly at one o'clock; and mind and leave there
    precisely at two and not a moment later. When the swans carry you over
    to the castle, you will pass all these things, all fast asleep, but
    you must not notice any of them.</p>
    <p>"When you go in, you will turn up to the right; you will see some
    grand rooms, then you will go downstairs through the cooking kitchen,
    and through; a door on your left you go into a garden, where you will
    find the apples you want for your father to get well. After you fill
    your wallet, you make all speed you possibly can, and call out for the
    swans to carry you over the same as before. After you get on your
    horse, should you hear anything shouting or making any noise after
    you, be sure not to look back, as they will follow you for thousands
    of miles; but when the time is up and you get near my place, it will
    be all over. Well now, my young man, I have told you all you have to
    do to-morrow; and mind, whatever you do, don't look about you when you
    see all those frightful things asleep. Keep a good heart, and make
    haste from there, and come back to me with all the speed you can. I
    should like to know how my two brothers were when you left them, and
    what they said to you about me."</p>

    <p>"Well, to tell the truth, before I left London my father was sick,
    and said I was to come here to look for the golden apples, for they
    were the only things that would do him good; and when I came to your
    youngest brother, he told me many things I had to do before I came
    here. And I thought once that your youngest brother put me in the
    wrong bed, when he put all those snakes to bite me all night long,
    until your second brother told me 'So it was to be,' and said, 'It is
    the same here,' but said you had none in your beds."</p>
    <p>"Well, let's go to bed. You need not fear. There are no snakes
    here."</p>
    <p>The young man went to bed, and had a good night's rest, and got up
    the next morning as fresh as newly caught trout. Breakfast being over,
    out comes the other horse, and, while saddling and fettling, the old
    man began to laugh, and told the young gentleman that if he saw a
    pretty young lady, not to stay with her too long, because she might
    waken, and then he would have to stay with her or to be turned into
    one of those unearthly monsters, like those he would have to pass by
    going into the castle.</p>
    <p>"Ha! ha! ha! you make me laugh so that I can scarcely buckle the
    saddle-straps. I think I shall make it all right, my uncle, if I see a
    young lady there, you may depend."</p>
    <p>"Well, my boy, I shall see how you will get on."</p>
    <p>So he mounts his Arab steed, and off he goes like a shot out of a
    gun. At last he comes in sight of the castle. He ties his horse safe
    to a tree, and pulls out his watch. It was then a quarter to one, when
    he called out, "Swan, swan, carry me over, for the name of the old
    Griffin of the Greenwood." No sooner said than done. A swan under each
    side, and one in front, took him over in a crack. He got on his legs,
    and walked quietly by all those giants, lions, fiery serpents, and all
    manner of other frightful things too numerous to mention, while they
    were fast asleep, and that only for the space of one hour, when into
    the castle he goes neck or nothing. Turning to the right, upstairs he
    runs, and enters into a very grand bedroom, and sees a beautiful
    Princess lying full stretch on a gold bedstead, fast asleep. He gazed
    on her beautiful form with admiration, and he takes her garter off,
    and buckles it on his own leg, and he buckles his on hers; he also
    takes her gold watch and pocket-handkerchief, and exchanges his for
    hers; after that he ventures to give her a kiss, when she very nearly
    opened her eyes. Seeing the time short, off he runs downstairs, and
    passing through the kitchen to go into the garden for the apples, he
    could see the cook all-fours on her back on the middle of the floor,
    with the knife in one hand and the fork in the other. He found the
    apples, and filled the wallet; and on passing through the kitchen the
    cook near wakened, but he was obliged to make all the speed he
    possibly could, as the time was nearly up. He called out for the
    swans, and they managed to take him over; but they found that he was a
    little heavier than before. No sooner than he had mounted his horse he
    could hear a tremendous noise, the enchantment was broke, and they
    tried to follow him, but all to no purpose. He was not long before he
    came to the oldest brother's house; and glad enough he was to see it,
    for the sight and the noise of all those things that were after him
    nearly frightened him to death.</p>
    <p>"Welcome, my boy; I am proud to see you. Dismount and put the horse
    in the stable, and come in and have some refreshments; I know you are
    hungry after all you have gone through in that castle. And tell me all
    you did, and all you saw there. Other kings' sons went by here to go
    to that castle, but they never came back alive, and you are the only
    one that ever broke the spell. And now you must come with me, with a
    sword in your hand, and must cut my head off, and must throw it in
    that well."</p>
    <p>The young Prince dismounts, and puts his horse in the stable, and
    they go in to have some refreshments, for I can assure you he wanted
    some; and after telling everything that passed, which the old
    gentleman was very pleased to hear, they both went for a walk
    together, the young Prince looking around and seeing the place looking
    dreadful, as did the old man. He could scarcely walk from his
    toe-nails curling up like ram's horns that had not been cut for many
    hundred years, and big long hair. They come to a well, and the old man
    gives the Prince a sword, and tells him to cut his head off, and throw
    it in that well. The young man has to do it against his wish, but has
    to do it.</p>
    <p>No sooner has he flung the head in the well, than up springs one of
    the finest young gentlemen you would wish to see; and instead of the
    old house and the frightful-looking place, it was changed into a
    beautiful hall and grounds. And they went back and enjoyed themselves
    well, and had a good laugh about the castle.</p>
    <p>The young Prince leaves this young gentleman in all his glory, and
    he tells the young Prince before leaving that he will see him again
    before long. They have a jolly shake-hands, and off he goes to the
    next oldest brother; and, to make my long story short, he has to serve
    the other two brothers the same as the first.</p>
    <p>Now the youngest brother began to ask him how things went on. "Did
    you see my two brothers?"</p>
    <p>"Yes."</p>
    <p>"How did they look?"</p>
    <p>"Oh! they looked very well. I liked them much. They told me many
    things what to do."</p>
    <p>"Well, did you go to the castle?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, my uncle."</p>
    <p>"And will you tell me what you see in there? Did you see the young
    lady?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, I saw her, and plenty of other frightful things."</p>
    <p>"Did you hear any snake biting you in my oldest brother's bed?"</p>
    <p>"No, there were none there; I slept well."</p>
    <p>"You won't have to sleep in the same bed to-night. You will have to
    cut my head off in the morning."</p>
    <p>The young Prince had a good night's rest, and changed all the
    appearance of the place by cutting his friend's head off before he
    started in the morning. A jolly shake-hands, and the uncle tells him
    it's very probable he shall see him again soon when he is not aware of
    it. This one's mansion was very pretty, and the country around it
    beautiful, after his head was cut off. Off Jack goes, over hills,
    dales, valleys, and mountains, and very near losing his apples
    again.</p>
    <p>At last he arrives at the cross-roads, where he has to meet his
    brothers on the very day appointed. Coming up to the place, he sees no
    tracks of horses, and, being very tired, he lays himself down to
    sleep, by tying the horse to his leg, and putting the apples under his
    head. Presently up come the other brothers the same time to the
    minute, and found him fast asleep; and they would not waken him, but
    said one to another, "Let us see what sort of apples he has got under
    his head." So they took and tasted them, and found they were different
    to theirs. They took and changed his apples for theirs, and off to
    London as fast as they could, and left the poor fellow sleeping.</p>
    <p>After a while he awoke, and, seeing the tracks of other horses, he
    mounted and off with him, not thinking anything about the apples being
    changed. He had still a long way to go, and by the time he got near
    London he could hear all the bells in the town ringing, but did not
    know what was the matter till he rode up to the palace, when he came
    to know that his father was recovered by his brothers' apples. When he
    got there his two brothers were off to some sports for a while; and
    the King was glad to see his youngest son, and very anxious to taste
    his apples. But when he found out that they were not good, and thought
    that they were more for poisoning him, he sent immediately for the
    headsman to behead his youngest son, who was taken away there and then
    in a carriage. But instead of the headsman taking his head off, he
    took him to a forest not far from the town, because he had pity on
    him, and there left him to take his chance, when presently up comes a
    big hairy bear, limping upon three legs. The Prince, poor fellow,
    climbed up a tree, frightened of him, but the bear told him to come
    down, that it was no use of him to stop there. With hard persuasion
    poor Jack comes down, and the bear speaks to him and bids him "Come
    here to me; I will not do you any harm. It's better for you to come
    with me and have some refreshments; I know that you are hungry all
    this time."</p>
    <p>The poor young Prince says, "No, I am not hungry; but I was very
    frightened when I saw you coming to me first, as I had no place to run
    away from you."</p>
    <p>The bear said, "I was also afraid of you when I saw that gentleman
    setting you down from the carriage. I thought you would have guns with
    you, and that you would not mind killing me if you saw me; but when I
    saw the gentleman going away with the carriage, and leaving you behind
    by yourself, I made bold to come to you, to see who you were, and now
    I know who you are very well. Are you not the king's youngest son? I
    have seen you and your brothers and lots of other gentlemen in this
    wood many times. Now before we go from here, I must tell you that I am
    in disguise; and I shall take you where we are stopping."</p>
    <p>The young Prince tells him everything from first to last, how he
    started in search of the apples, and about the three old men, and
    about the castle, and how he was served at last by his father after he
    came home; and instead of the headsman taking his head off, he was
    kind enough to leave him his life, "and here I am now, under your
    protection."</p>
    <p>The bear tells him, "Come on, my brother; there shall no harm come
    to you as long as you are with me."</p>
    <p>So he takes him up to the tents; and when they see 'em coming, the
    girls begin to laugh, and say, "Here is our Jubal coming with a young
    gentleman." When he advanced nearer the tents, they all knew that he
    was the young Prince that had passed by that way many times before;
    and when Jubal went to change himself, he called most of them together
    into one tent, and told them all about him, and to be kind to him. And
    so they were, for there was nothing that he desired but what he had,
    the same as if he was in the palace with his father and mother. Jubal,
    after he pulled off his hairy coat, was one of the finest young men
    amongst them, and he was the young Prince's closest companion. The
    young Prince was always very sociable and merry, only when he thought
    of the gold watch he had from the young Princess in the castle, and
    which he had lost he knew not where.</p>
    <p>He passed off many happy days in the forest; but one day he and
    poor Jubal were strolling through the trees, when they came to the
    very spot where they first met, and, accidentally looking up, he could
    see his watch hanging in the tree which he had to climb when he first
    saw poor Jubal coming to him in the form of a bear; and he cries out,
    "Jubal, Jubal, I can see my watch up in that tree."</p>
    <p>"Well, I am sure, how lucky!" exclaimed poor Jubal; "shall I go and
    get it down?"</p>
    <p>"No, I'd rather go myself," said the young Prince.</p>
    <p>Now whilst all this was going on, the young Princess in that
    castle, seeing that one of the King of England's sons had been there
    by the changing of the watch and other things, got herself ready with
    a large army, and sailed off for England. She left her army a little
    out of the town, and she went with her guards straight up to the
    palace to see the King, and also demanded to see his sons. They had a
    long conversation together about different things. At last she demands
    one of the sons to come before her; and the oldest comes, when she
    asks him, "Have you ever been at the Castle of Melvales?" and he
    answers, "Yes." She throws down a pocket handkerchief and bids him to
    walk over it without stumbling. He goes to walk over it, and no sooner
    did he put his foot on it, than he fell down and broke his leg. He was
    taken off immediately and made a prisoner of by her own guards. The
    other was called upon, and was asked the same questions, and I had to
    go through the same performance, and he also was made a prisoner of.
    Now she says, "Have you not another son?" when the King began so to
    shiver and shake and knock his two knees together that he could
    scarcely stand upon his legs, and did not know what to say to her, he
    was so much frightened. At last a thought came to him to send for his
    headsman, and inquire of him particularly, Did he behead his son, or
    was he alive?</p>
    <p>"He is saved, O King."</p>
    <p>"Then bring him here immediately, or else I shall be done for."</p>
    <p>Two of the fastest horses they had were put in the carriage, to go
    and look for the poor Prince; and when they got to the very spot where
    they left him, it was the time when the Prince was up the tree,
    getting his watch down, and poor Jubal standing a distance off. They
    cried out to him, Had he seen another young man in this wood? Jubal,
    seeing such a nice carriage, thought something, and did not like to
    say No, and said Yes, and pointed up the tree; and they told him to
    come down immediately, as there was a young lady in search of him.</p>
    <p>"Ha! ha! ha! Jubal, did you ever hear such a thing in all your
    life, my brother?"</p>
    <p>"Do you call him your brother?"</p>
    <p>"Well, he has been better to me than my brothers."</p>
    <p>"Well, for his kindness he shall accompany you to the palace, and
    see how things turn out."</p>
    <p>After they go to the palace, the Prince has a good wash, and
    appears before the Princess, when she asks him, Had he ever been at
    the Castle of Melvales? With a smile upon his face, he gives a
    graceful bow. And says my Lady, "Walk over that handkerchief without
    stumbling." He walks over it many times, and dances upon it, and
    nothing happened to him. She said, with a proud and smiling air, "That
    is the young man;" and out come the objects exchanged by both of them.
    Presently she orders a very large box to be brought in and to be
    opened, and out come some of the most costly uniforms that were ever
    worn on an emperor's back; and when he dressed himself up, the King
    could scarcely look upon him from the dazzling of the gold and
    diamonds on his coat. He orders his two brothers to be in confinement
    for a period of time; and before the Princess asks him to go with her
    to her own country, she pays a visit to the bear's camp, and she makes
    some very handsome presents for their kindness to the young Prince.
    And she gives Jubal an invitation to go with them, which he accepts;
    wishes them a hearty farewell for a while, promising to see them all
    again in some little time.</p>
    <p>They go back to the King and bid farewell, and tell him not to be
    so hasty another time to order people to be beheaded before having a
    proper cause for it. Off they go with all their army with them; but
    while the soldiers were striking their tents, the Prince bethought
    himself of his Welsh harp, and had it sent for immediately to take
    with him in a beautiful wooden case. They called to see each of those
    three brothers whom the Prince had to stay with when he was on his way
    to the Castle of Melvales; and I can assure you, when they all got
    together, they had a very merry time of it. And there we will leave
    them.</p>

    <p>In the reign of King John there lived an Abbot of Canterbury who
    kept up grand state in his Abbey. A hundred of the Abbot's men dined
    each day with him in his refectory, and fifty knights in velvet coats
    and gold chains waited upon him daily. Well, King John, as you know,
    was a very bad king, and he couldn't brook the idea of any one in his
    kingdom, however holy he might be, being honoured more than he. So he
    summoned the Abbot of Canterbury to his presence.</p>
    <p>The Abbot came with a goodly retinue, with his fifty
    knights-at-arms in velvet cloaks and gold chains. The King went to
    meet him, and said to him, "How now, father Abbot? I hear it of thee,
    thou keepest far greater state than I. This becomes not our royal
    dignity, and savours of treason in thee."</p>
    <p>"My liege," quoth the Abbot, bending low, "I beg to say that all I
    spend has been freely given to the Abbey out of the piety of the folk.
    I trust your Grace will not take it ill that I spend for the Abbey's
    sake what is the Abbey's."</p>
    <p>"Nay, proud prelate," answered the King, "all that is in this fair
    realm of England is our own, and thou hast no right to put me to shame
    by holding such state. However, of my clemency I will spare thee thy
    life and thy property if you can answer me but three questions."</p>
    <p>"I will do so, my liege," said the Abbot, "so far as my poor wit
    can extend."</p>
    <p>"Well, then," said the King, "tell me where is the centre of all
    the world round; then let me know how soon can I ride the whole world
    about; and, lastly, tell me what I think."</p>
    <p>"Your Majesty jesteth," stammered the Abbot.</p>
    <p>"Thou wilt find it no jest," said the King. "Unless thou canst
    answer me these questions three before a week is out, thy head will
    leave thy body;" and he turned away.</p>
    <p>Well, the Abbot rode off in fear and trembling, and first he went
    to Oxford to see if any learned doctor could tell him the answer to
    those questions three; but none could help him, and he took his way to
    Canterbury, sad and sorrowful, to take leave of his monks. But on his
    way he met his shepherd as he was going to the fold.</p>
    <p>"Welcome home, Lord Abbot," quoth the shepherd; "what news from
    good King John?"</p>
    <p>"Sad news, sad news, my shepherd," said the Abbot, and told him all
    that had happened.</p>
    <p>"Now, cheer up, Sir Abbot," said the shepherd. "A fool may perhaps
    answer what a wise man knows not. I will go to London in your stead;
    grant me only your apparel and your retinue of knights. At the least I
    can die in your place."</p>
    <p>"Nay, shepherd, not so," said the Abbot; "I must meet the danger in
    my own person. And to that, thou canst not pass for me."</p>
    <p>"But I can and I will, Sir Abbot. In a cowl, who will know me for
    what I am?"</p>
    <p>So at last the Abbot consented, and sent him to London in his most
    splendid array, and he approached King John with all his retinue as
    before, but dressed in his simple monk's dress and his cowl over his
    face.</p>

    height='332' align='right' alt='"...I am but his poor shepherd..."'
    border='0' />
    <p>"Now welcome, Sir Abbot," said King John; "thou art prepared for
    thy doom, I see."</p>
    <p>"I am ready to answer your Majesty," said he.</p>
    <p>"Well, then, question first&mdash;where is the centre of the round
    earth?" said the King.</p>
    <p>"Here," said the shepherd Abbot, planting his crozier in the
    ground; "an' your Majesty believe me not, go measure it and see."</p>
    <p>"By St. Botolph," said the King, "a merry answer and a shrewd; so
    to question the second. How soon may I ride this round world
    about?"</p>
    <p>"If your Majesty will graciously rise with the sun, and ride along
    with him until the next morning he rise, your Grace will surely have
    ridden it round."</p>
    <p>"By St. John," laughed King John, "I did not think it could be done
    so soon. But let that pass, and tell me question third and last, and
    that is&mdash;What do I think?"</p>
    <p>"That is easy, your Grace," said he. "Your Majesty thinks I am my
    lord the Abbot of Canterbury; but as you may see," and here he raised
    his cowl, "I am but his poor shepherd, that am come to ask your pardon
    for him and for me."</p>
    <p>Loud laughed the King. "Well caught. Thou hast more wit than thy
    lord, and thou shalt be Abbot in his place."</p>
    <p>"Nay, that cannot be," quoth the shepherd; "I know not to write nor
    to read."</p>
    <p>"Well, then, four nobles a week thou shalt have for the ready wit.
    And tell the Abbot from me that he has my pardon." And with that King
    John sent away the shepherd with a right royal present, besides his
    pension.</p>

    <h2>Rushen Coatie</h2>
    <br />

    <p>There was once a king and a queen, as many a one has been; few have
    we seen, and as few may we see. But the queen died, leaving only one
    bonny girl, and she told her on her death-bed: "My dear, after I am
    gone, there will come to you a little red calf, and whenever you want
    anything, speak to it, and it will give it you."</p>
    <p>Now, after a while, the king married again an ill-natured wife,
    with three ugly daughters of her own. And they hated the king's
    daughter because she was so bonny. So they took all her fine clothes
    away from her, and gave her only a coat made of rushes. So they called
    her Rushen Coatie, and made her sit in the kitchen nook, amid the
    ashes. And when dinner-time came, the nasty stepmother sent her out a
    thimbleful of broth, a grain of barley, a thread of meat, and a crumb
    of bread. But when she had eaten all this, she was just as hungry as
    before, so she said to herself: "Oh! how I wish I had something to
    eat." Just then, who should come in but a little red calf, and said to
    her: "Put your finger into my left ear." She did so, and found some
    nice bread. Then the calf told her to put her finger into its right
    ear, and she found there some cheese, and made a right good meal of
    the bread and cheese. And so it went on from day to day.</p>
    <p>Now the king's wife thought Rushen Coatie would soon die from the
    scanty food she got, and she was surprised to see her as lively and
    healthy as ever. So she set one of her ugly daughters on the watch at
    meal times to find out how Rushen Coatie got enough to live on. The
    daughter soon found out that the red calf gave food to Rushen Coatie,
    and told her mother. So her mother went to the king and told him she
    was longing to have a sweetbread from a red calf. Then the king sent
    for his butcher, and had the little red calf killed. And when Rushen
    Coatie heard of it, she sate down and wept by its side, but the dead
    calf said:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Take me up, bone by
    bone,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And put me beneath yon grey
    stone;</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>When there is aught you
    want</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Tell it me, and that I'll
    grant."</span><br />

    <p>So she did so, but could not find the shank-bone of the calf.</p>
    <p>Now the very next Sunday was Yuletide, and all the folk were going
    to church in their best clothes, so Rushen Coatie said: "Oh! I should
    like to go to church, too," but the three ugly sisters said: "What
    would you do at the church, you nasty thing? You must bide at home and
    make the dinner." And the king's wife said: "And this is what you must
    make the soup of, a thimbleful of water, a grain of barley, and a
    crumb of bread."</p>
    <p>When they all went to church, Rushen Coatie sat down and wept, but
    looking up, who should she see coming in limping, lamping, with a
    shank wanting, but the dear red calf? And the red calf said to her:
    "Do not sit there weeping, but go, put on these clothes, and above
    all, put on this pair of glass slippers, and go your way to
    church."</p>
    <p>"But what will become of the dinner?" said Rushen Coatie.</p>
    <p>"Oh, do not fash about that," said the red calf, "all you have to
    do is to say to the fire:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"'Every peat make t'other
    burn,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Every spit make t'other
    turn,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Every pot make t'other
    play,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Till I come from church this good
    Yuleday,'</span><br />

    <p>and be off to church with you. But mind you come home first."</p>
    <p>So Rushen Coatie said this, and went off to church, and she was the
    grandest and finest lady there. There happened to be a young prince
    there, and he fell at once in love with her. But she came away before
    service was over, and was home before the rest, and had off her fine
    clothes and on with her rushen coatie, and she found the calf had
    covered the table, and the dinner was ready, and everything was in
    good order when the rest came home. The three sisters said to Rushen
    Coatie: "Eh, lassie, if you had seen the bonny fine lady in church
    to-day, that the young prince fell in love with!" Then she said: "Oh!
    I wish you would let me go with you to the church to-morrow," for they
    used to go three days together to church at Yuletide.</p>
    <p>But they said: "What should the like of you do at church, nasty
    thing? The kitchen nook is good enough for you."</p>
    <p>So the next day they all went to church, and Rushen Coatie was left
    behind, to make dinner out of a thimbleful of water, a grain of
    barley, a crumb of bread, and a thread of meat. But the red calf came
    to her help again, gave her finer clothes than before, and she went to
    church, where all the world was looking at her, and wondering where
    such a grand lady came from, and the prince fell more in love with her
    than ever, and tried to find out where she went to. But she was too
    quick for him, and got home long before the rest, and the red calf had
    the dinner all ready.</p>
    <p>The next day the calf dressed her in even grander clothes than
    before, and she went to the church. And the young prince was there
    again, and this time he put a guard at the door to keep her, but she
    took a hop and a run and jumped over their heads, and as she did so,
    down fell one of her glass slippers. She didn't wait to pick it up,
    you may be sure, but off she ran home, as fast as she could go, on
    with the rushen coatie, and the calf had all things ready.</p>
    <p>Then the young prince put out a proclamation that whoever could put
    on the glass slipper should be his bride. All the ladies of his court
    went and tried to put on the slipper. And they tried and tried and
    tried, but it was too small for them all. Then he ordered one of his
    ambassadors to mount a fleet horse and ride through the kingdom and
    find an owner for the glass shoe. He rode and he rode to town and
    castle, and made all the ladies try to put on the shoe. Many a one
    tried to get it on that she might be the prince's bride. But no, it
    wouldn't do, and many a one wept, I warrant, because she couldn't get
    on the bonny glass shoe. The ambassador rode on and on till he came at
    the very last to the house where there were the three ugly sisters.
    The first two tried it and it wouldn't do, and the queen, mad with
    spite, hacked off the toes and heels of the third sister, and she
    could then put the slipper on, and the prince was brought to marry
    her, for he had to keep his promise. The ugly sister was dressed all
    in her best and was put up behind the prince on horseback, and off
    they rode in great gallantry. But ye all know, pride must have a fall,
    for as they rode along a raven sang out of a bush&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Hack&egrave;d Heels and
    Pinch&egrave;d Toes</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Behind the young prince
    rides,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But Pretty Feet and Little
    Feet</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Behind the cauldron
    bides."</span><br />

    <p>"What's that the birdie sings?" said the young prince.</p>
    <p>"Nasty, lying thing," said the step-sister, "never mind what it
    says."</p>
    <p>But the prince looked down and saw the slipper dripping with blood,
    so he rode back and put her down. Then he said, "There must be some
    one that the slipper has not been tried on."</p>
    <p>"Oh, no," said they, "there's none but a dirty thing that sits in
    the kitchen nook and wears a rushen coatie."</p>
    <p>But the prince was determined to try it on Rushen Coatie, but she
    ran away to the grey stone, where the red calf dressed her in her
    bravest dress, and she went to the prince and the slipper jumped out
    of his pocket on to her foot, fitting her without any chipping or
    paring. So the prince married her that very day, and they lived happy
    ever after.</p>

    <h2>The King o' the Cats</h2>
    <br />

    <p>One winter's evening the sexton's wife was sitting by the fireside
    with her big black cat, Old Tom, on the other side, both half asleep
    and waiting for the master to come home. They waited and they waited,
    but still he didn't come, till at last he came rushing in, calling
    out, "Who's Tommy Tildrum?" in such a wild way that both his wife and
    his cat stared at him to know what was the matter.</p>
    <p>"Why, what's the matter?" said his wife, "and why do you want to
    know who Tommy Tildrum is?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, I've had such an adventure. I was digging away at old Mr.
    Fordyce's grave when I suppose I must have dropped asleep, and only
    woke up by hearing a cat's <i>Miaou</i>."</p>
    <p>"<i>Miaou!</i>" said Old Tom in answer.</p>
    <p>"Yes, just like that! So I looked over the edge of the grave, and
    what do you think I saw?"</p>
    <p>"Now, how can I tell?" said the sexton's wife.</p>
    <p>"Why, nine black cats all like our friend Tom here, all with a
    white spot on their chestesses. And what do you think they were
    carrying? Why, a small coffin covered with a black velvet pall, and on
    the pall was a small coronet all of gold, and at every third step they
    took they cried all together, <i>Miaou</i>&mdash;"</p>
    <p>"<i>Miaou!</i>" said Old Tom again.</p>
    <p>"Yes, just like that!" said the Sexton; "and as they came nearer
    and nearer to me I could see them more distinctly, because their eyes
    shone out with a sort of green light. Well, they all came towards me,
    eight of them carrying the coffin, and the biggest cat of all walking
    in front for all the world like&mdash;but look at our Tom, how he's
    looking at me. You'd think he knew all I was saying."</p>
    <p>"Go on, go on," said his wife; "never mind Old Tom."</p>
    <p>"Well, as I was a-saying, they came towards me slowly and solemnly,
    and at every third step crying all together, <i>Miaou!</i>&mdash;"</p>
    <p>"<i>Miaou!</i>" said Old Tom again.</p>
    <p>"Yes, just like that, till they came and stood right opposite Mr.
    Fordyce's grave, where I was, when they all stood still and looked
    straight at me. I did feel queer, that I did! But look at Old Tom;
    he's looking at me just like they did."</p>
    <p>"Go on, go on," said his wife; "never mind Old Tom."</p>
    <p>"Where was I? Oh, they all stood still looking at me, when the one
    that wasn't carrying the coffin came forward and, staring straight at
    me, said to me&mdash;yes, I tell 'ee, <i>said</i> to me, with a
    squeaky voice, 'Tell Tom Tildrum that Tim Toldrum's dead,' and that's
    why I asked you if you knew who Tom Tildrum was, for how can I tell
    Tom Tildrum Tim Toldrum's dead if I don't know who Tom Tildrum
    is?"</p>
    <p>"Look at Old Tom, look at Old Tom!" screamed his wife.</p>
    <p>And well he might look, for Tom was swelling and Tom was staring,
    and at last Tom shrieked out, "What&mdash;old Tim dead! then I'm the
    King o' the Cats!" and rushed up the chimney and was never more
    seen.</p>

    <a id="Tamlane" name='Tamlane'></a>
    <h2>Tamlane</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Young Tamlane was son of Earl Murray, and Burd Janet was daughter
    of Dunbar, Earl of March. And when they were young they loved one
    another and plighted their troth. But when the time came near for
    their marrying, Tamlane disappeared, and none knew what had become of
    him.</p>
    <p>Many, many days after he had disappeared, Burd Janet was wandering
    in Carterhaugh Wood, though she had been warned not to go there. And
    as she wandered she plucked the flowers from the bushes. She came at
    last to a bush of broom and began plucking it. She had not taken more
    than three flowerets when by her side up started young Tamlane.</p>
    <p>"Where come ye from, Tamlane, Tamlane?" Burd Janet said; "and why
    have you been away so long?"</p>
    <p>"From Elfland I come," said young Tamlane. "The Queen of Elfland
    has made me her knight."</p>
    <p>"But how did you get there, Tamlane?" said Burd Janet.</p>
    <p>"I was hunting one day, and as I rode widershins round yon hill, a
    deep drowsiness fell upon me, and when I awoke, behold! I was in
    Elfland. Fair is that land and gay, and fain would I stop but for thee
    and one other thing. Every seven years the Elves pay their tithe to
    the Nether world, and for all the Queen makes much of me, I fear it is
    myself that will be the tithe."</p>
    <p>"Oh can you not be saved? Tell me if aught I can do will save you,
    Tamlane?"</p>
    <p>"One only thing is there for my safety. To-morrow night is
    Hallowe'en, and the fairy court will then ride through England and
    Scotland, and if you would borrow me from Elfland you must take your
    stand by Miles Cross between twelve and one o' the night, and with
    holy water in your hand you must cast a compass all around you."</p>
    <p>"But how shall I know you, Tamlane?" quoth Burd Janet, "amid so
    many knights I've ne'er seen before?"</p>
    <img src='images/illus188.jpg' width='200' height='445' align='left'
    alt='Burd Janet' border='0' />
    <p>"The first court of Elves that come by let pass. The next court you
    shall pay reverence to, but do naught nor say aught. But the third
    court that comes by is the chief court of them, and at the head rides
    the Queen of all Elfland. And I shall ride by her side upon a
    milk-white steed with a star in my crown; they give me this honour as
    being a christened knight. Watch my hands, Janet, the right one will
    be gloved but the left one will be bare, and by that token you will
    know me."</p>
    <p>"But how to save you, Tamlane?" quoth Burd Janet.</p>
    <p>"You must spring upon me suddenly, and I will fall to the ground.
    Then seize me quick, and whatever change befall me, for they will
    exercise all their magic on me, cling hold to me till they turn me
    into red-hot iron. Then cast me into this pool and I will be turned
    back into a mother-naked man. Cast then your green mantle over me, and
    I shall be yours, and be of the world again."</p>
    <p>So Burd Janet promised to do all for Tamlane, and next night at
    midnight she took her stand by Miles Cross and cast a compass round
    her with holy water.</p>
    <p>Soon there came riding by the Elfin court, first over the mound
    went a troop on black steeds, and then another troop on brown. But in
    the third court, all on milk-white steeds, she saw the Queen of
    Elfland, and by her side a knight with a star in his crown, with right
    hand gloved and the left bare. Then she knew this was her own Tamlane,
    and springing forward she seized the bridle of the milk-white steed
    and pulled its rider down. And as soon as he had touched the ground
    she let go the bridle and seized him in her arms.</p>
    <p>"He's won, he's won amongst us all," shrieked out the eldritch
    crew, and all came around her and tried their spells on young
    Tamlane.</p>
    <p>First they turned him in Janet's arms like frozen ice, then into a
    huge flame of roaring fire. Then, again, the fire vanished and an
    adder was skipping through her arms, but still she held on; and then
    they turned him into a snake that reared up as if to bite her, and yet
    she held on. Then suddenly a dove was struggling in her arms, and
    almost flew away. Then they turned him into a swan, but all was in
    vain, till at last he was turned into a red-hot glaive, and this she
    cast into a well of water and then he turned back into a mother-naked
    man. She quickly cast her green mantle over him, and young Tamlane was
    Burd Janet's for ever.</p>
    <p>Then sang the Queen of Elfland as the court turned away and began
    to resume its march:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"She that has borrowed young
    Tamlane</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3.5em;'>Has gotten a stately

     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"But had I known, Tamlane,

    <h2>The Stars in the Sky</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once on a time and twice on a time, and all times together as ever
    I heard tell of, there was a tiny lassie who would weep all day to
    have the stars in the sky to play with; she wouldn't have this, and
    she wouldn't have that, but it was always the stars she would have. So
    one fine day off she went to find them. And she walked and she walked
    and she walked, till by-and-by she came to a mill-dam.</p>
    <p>"Goode'en to ye," says she, "I'm seeking the stars in the sky to
    play with. Have you seen any?"</p>
    <p>"Oh, yes, my bonnie lassie," said the mill-dam. "They shine in my
    own face o' nights till I can't sleep for them. Jump in and perhaps
    you'll find one."</p>
    <p>So she jumped in, and swam about and swam about and swam about, but
    ne'er a one could she see. So she went on till she came to a
    brooklet.</p>
    <p>"Goode'en to ye, Brooklet, Brooklet," says she; "I'm seeking the
    stars in the sky to play with. Have you seen any?"</p>
    <p>"Yes, indeed, my bonny lassie," said the Brooklet. "They glint on
    my banks at night. Paddle about, and maybe you'll find one."</p>
    <p>So she paddled and she paddled and she paddled, but ne'er a one did
    she find. So on she went till she came to the Good Folk.</p>
    <p>"Goode'en to ye, Good Folk," says she; "I'm looking for the stars
    in the sky to play with. Have ye seen e'er a one?"</p>
    <p>"Why, yes, my bonny lassie," said the Good Folk. "They shine on the
    grass here o' night. Dance with us, and maybe you'll find one."</p>
    <p>And she danced and she danced and she danced, but ne'er a one did
    she see. So down she sate; I suppose she wept.</p>
    <p>"Oh dearie me, oh dearie me," says she, "I've swam and I've paddled
    and I've danced, and if ye'll not help me I shall never find the stars
    in the sky to play with."</p>
    <p>But the Good Folk whispered together, and one of them came up to
    her and took her by the hand and said, "If you won't go home to your
    mother, go forward, go forward; mind you take the right road. Ask Four
    Feet to carry you to No Feet at all, and tell No Feet at all to carry
    you to the stairs without steps, and if you can climb that&mdash;"</p>
    <p>"Oh, shall I be among the stars in the sky then?" cried the
    lassie.</p>
    <p>"If you'll not be, then you'll be elsewhere," said the Good Folk,
    and set to dancing again.</p>
    <p>So on she went again with a light heart, and by-and-by she came to
    a saddled horse, tied to a tree.</p>
    <p>"Goode'en to ye, Beast," said she; "I'm seeking the stars in the
    sky to play with. Will you give me a lift, for all my bones are
    an-aching."</p>
    <p>"Nay," said the horse, "I know nought of the stars in the sky, and
    I'm here to do the bidding of the Good Folk, and not my own will."</p>
    <p>"Well," said she, "it's from the Good Folk I come, and they bade me
    tell Four Feet to carry me to No Feet at all."</p>
    <p>"That's another story," said he; "jump up and ride with me."</p>
    <p>So they rode and they rode and they rode, till they got out of the
    forest and found themselves at the edge of the sea. And on the water
    in front of them was a wide glistening path running straight out
    towards a beautiful thing that rose out of the water and went up into
    the sky, and was all the colours in the world, blue and red and green,
    and wonderful to look at.</p>
    <p>"Now get you down," said the horse; "I've brought ye to the end of
    the land, and that's as much as Four Feet can do. I must away home to
    my own folk."</p>
    <p>"But," said the lassie, "where's No Feet at all, and where's the
    stair without steps?"</p>
    <p>"I know not," said the horse, "it's none of my business neither. So
    goode'en to ye, my bonny lassie;" and off he went.</p>
    <p>So the lassie stood still and looked at the water, till a strange
    kind of fish came swimming up to her feet.</p>
    <p>"Goode'en to ye, big Fish," says she, "I'm looking for the stars in
    the sky, and for the stairs that climb up to them. Will ye show me the
    way?"</p>
    <p>"Nay," said the Fish, "I can't unless you bring me word from the
    Good Folk."</p>
    <p>"Yes, indeed," said she. "They said Four Feet would bring me to No
    Feet at all, and No Feet at all would carry me to the stairs without
    steps."</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus194.jpg' width='450' height='369'
      alt=' "Get on my back and hold fast."' border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>"Ah, well," said the Fish; "that's all right then. Get on my back
    and hold fast."</p>
    <p>And off he went&mdash;Kerplash!&mdash;into the water, along the
    silver path, towards the bright arch. And the nearer they came the
    brighter the sheen of it, till she had to shade her eyes from the
    light of it.</p>
    <p>And as they came to the foot of it, she saw it was a broad bright
    road, sloping up and away into the sky, and at the far, far end of it
    she could see wee shining things dancing about.</p>
    <p>"Now," said the Fish, "here you are, and yon's the stair; climb up,
    if you can, but hold on fast. I'll warrant you find the stair easier
    at home than by such a way; 't was ne'er meant for lassies' feet to
    travel;" and off he splashed through the water.</p>
    <p>So she clomb and she clomb and she clomb, but ne'er a step higher
    did she get: the light was before her and around her, and the water
    behind her, and the more she struggled the more she was forced down
    into the dark and the cold, and the more she clomb the deeper she
    fell.</p>
    <p>But she clomb and she clomb, till she got dizzy in the light and
    shivered with the cold, and dazed with the fear; but still she clomb,
    till at last, quite dazed and silly-like, she let clean go, and sank
    down&mdash;down&mdash;down.</p>
    <p>And bang she came on to the hard boards, and found herself sitting,
    weeping and wailing, by the bedside at home all alone.</p>

    <a id="The_Little_Bull_Calf" name='The_Little_Bull_Calf'></a>
    <h2>The Little Bull-Calf</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Centuries of years ago, when almost all this part of the country
    was wilderness, there was a little boy, who lived in a poor bit of
    property and his father gave him a little bull-calf, and with it he
    gave him everything he wanted for it.</p>
    <p>But soon after his father died, and his mother got married again to
    a man that turned out to be a very vicious step-father, who couldn't
    abide the little boy. So at last the step-father said: "If you bring
    that bull-calf into this house, I'll kill it." What a villain he was,
    wasn't he?</p>
    <p>Now this little boy used to go out and feed his bull-calf every day
    with barley bread, and when he did so this time, an old man came up to
    him&mdash;we can guess who that was, eh?&mdash;and said to him: "You
    and your bull-calf had better go away and seek your fortune."</p>
    <p>So he went on and he went on and he went on, as far as I could tell
    you till to-morrow night, and he went up to a farmhouse and begged a
    crust of bread, and when he got back he broke it in two and gave half
    of it to the bull-calf. And he went to another house and begged a bit
    of cheese crud, and when he went back he wanted to give half of it to
    the bull-calf. "No," says the bull-calf, "I'm going across the field,
    into the wild-wood wilderness country, where there'll be tigers,
    leopards, wolves, monkeys, and a fiery dragon, and I'll kill them all
    except the fiery dragon, and he'll kill me."</p>
    <p>The little boy did cry, and said: "Oh, no, my little bull-calf; I
    hope he won't kill you."</p>
    <p>"Yes, he will," said the little bull-calf, "so you climb up that
    tree, so that no one can come nigh you but the monkeys, and if they
    come the cheese crud will save you. And when I'm killed, the dragon
    will go away for a bit, then you must come down the tree and skin me,
    and take out my bladder and blow it out, and it will kill everything
    you hit with it. So when the fiery dragon comes back, you hit it with
    my bladder and cut its tongue out."</p>
    <p>(We know there were fiery dragons in those days, like George and
    his dragon in the legend; but, there! it's not the same world
    nowadays. The world is turned topsy-turvy since then, like as if you'd
    turn it over with a spade!)</p>
    <p>Of course, he did all the little bull-calf told him. He climbed up
    the tree, and the monkeys climbed up the tree after him. But he held
    the cheese crud in his hand, and said: "I'll squeeze your heart like
    the flint-stone." So the monkey cocked his eye as much as to say: "If
    you can squeeze a flint-stone to make the juice come out of it, you
    can squeeze me." But he didn't say anything, for a monkey's cunning,
    but down he went. And all the while the little bull-calf was fighting
    all the wild beasts on the ground, and the little lad was clapping his
    hands up the tree, and calling out: "Go in, my little bull-calf! Well
    fought, little bull-calf!" And he mastered everything except the fiery
    dragon, but the fiery dragon killed the little bull-calf.</p>
    <p>But the lad waited and waited till he saw the dragon go away, then
    he came down and skinned the little bull-calf, and took out its
    bladder and went after the dragon. And as he went on, what should he
    see but a king's daughter, staked down by the hair of her head, for
    she had been put there for the dragon to destroy her.</p>
    <p>So he went up and untied her hair, but she said: "My time has come
    for the dragon to destroy me; go away, you can do no good." But he
    said: "No! I can master it, and I won't go"; and for all her begging
    and praying he would stop.</p>
    <p>And soon he heard it coming, roaring and raging from afar off, and
    at last it came near, spitting fire, and with a tongue like a great
    spear, and you could hear it roaring for miles, and it was making for
    the place where the king's daughter was staked down. But when it came
    up to them, the lad just hit it on the head with the bladder and the
    dragon fell down dead, but before it died, it bit off the little boy's
    forefinger.</p>

    <center>
      <small><b><i>THE LITTLE BULL-CALF</i></b></small>
    </center>
    <br />

    <p>Then the lad cut out the dragon's tongue and said to the king's
    daughter: "I've done all I can, I must leave you." And sorry she was
    he had to go, and before he went she tied a diamond ring in his hair,
    and said good-bye to him.</p>
    <p>By-and-by, who should come along but the old king, lamenting and
    weeping, expecting to see nothing of his daughter but the prints of
    the place where she had been. But he was surprised to find her there
    alive and safe, and he said: "How came you to be saved?" So she told
    him how she had been saved, and he took her home to his castle
    again.</p>
    <p>Well, he put it into all the papers to find out who saved his
    daughter, and who had the dragon's tongue and the princess's diamond
    ring, and was without his forefinger. Whoever could show these signs
    should marry his daughter and have his kingdom after his death. Well,
    any number of gentlemen came from all parts of England, with
    forefingers cut off, and with diamond rings and all kinds of tongues,
    wild beasts' tongues and foreign tongues. But they couldn't show any
    dragons' tongues, so they were turned away.</p>
    <p>At last the little boy turned up, looking very ragged and desolated
    like, and the king's daughter cast her eye on him, till her father
    grew very angry and ordered them to turn the little beggar boy away.
    "Father," says she; "I know something of that boy."</p>
    <p>Well, still the fine gentlemen came, bringing up their dragons'
    tongues that weren't dragons' tongues, and at last the little boy came
    up, dressed a little better. So the old king says: "I see you've got
    an eye on that boy. If it has to be him it must be him." But all the
    others were fit to kill him, and cried out: "Pooh, pooh, turn that boy
    out, it can't be him." But the king said: "Now, my boy, let's see what
    you have to show." Well, he showed the diamond ring with her name on
    it, and the fiery dragon's tongue. How the others were thunderstruck
    when he showed his proofs! But the king told him: "You shall have my
    daughter and my estate."</p>
    <p>So he married the princess, and afterwards got the king's estate.
    Then his step-father came and wanted to own him, but the young king
    didn't know such a man.</p>

    <h2>The Wee, Wee Mannie</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Once upon a time, when all big folks were wee ones and all lies
    were true, there was a wee, wee Mannie that had a big, big Coo. And
    out he went to milk her of a morning, and said&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Hold still, my Coo, my
    hinny,</span><br />

     <span style='margin-left: 4em;'>What but a milk white
    doo."</span><br />

    <p>But the big, big Coo wouldn't hold still. "Hout!" said the wee, wee
    Mannie&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Hold still, my Coo, my
    dearie,</span><br />

    <p>So off he went to his mother at the house. "Mother," said he, "Coo
    won't stand still, and wee, wee Mannie can't milk big, big Coo."</p>
    <p>"Hout!" says his mother, "take stick and beat Coo."</p>
    <p>So off he went to get a stick from the tree, and said&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Break, stick, break,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And I'll gi'e ye a

    <p>But the stick wouldn't break, so back he went to the house.
    "Mother," says he, "Coo won't hold still, stick won't break, wee, wee
    Mannie can't beat big, big Coo."</p>
    <p>"Hout!" says his mother, "go to the Butcher and bid him kill

    <p>So off he went to the Butcher, and said&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Butcher, kill the big, big
    Coo,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>She'll gi'e us no more milk
    noo."</span><br />

    <p>But the Butcher wouldn't kill the Coo without a silver penny, so
    back the Mannie went to the house. "Mother," says he, "Coo won't hold
    still, stick won't break, Butcher won't kill without a silver penny,
    and wee, wee Mannie can't milk big, big Coo."</p>
    <p>"Well," said his mother, "go to the Coo and tell her there's a
    weary, weary lady with long yellow hair weeping for a cup o'
    milk."</p>
    <p>So off he went and told the Coo, but she wouldn't hold still, so
    back he went and told his mother.</p>
    <p>"Well," said she, "tell the Coo there's a fine, fine laddie from
    the wars sitting by the weary, weary lady with golden hair, and she
    weeping for a sup o' milk."</p>
    <p>So off he went and told the Coo, but she wouldn't hold still, so
    back he went and told his mother.</p>
    <p>"Well," said his mother, "tell the big, big Coo there's a sharp,
    sharp sword at the belt of the fine, fine laddie from the wars who
    sits beside the weary, weary lady with the golden hair, and she
    weeping for a sup o' milk."</p>
    <p>And he told the big, big Coo, but she wouldn't hold still.</p>
    <p>Then said his mother, "Run quick and tell her that her head's going
    to be cut off by the sharp, sharp sword in the hands of the fine, fine
    laddie, if she doesn't give the sup o' milk the weary, weary lady
    weeps for."</p>
    <p>And wee, wee Mannie went off and told the big, big Coo.</p>
    <p>And when Coo saw the glint of the sharp, sharp sword in the hand of
    the fine, fine laddie come from the wars, and the weary, weary lady
    weeping for a sup o' milk, she reckoned she'd better hold still; so
    wee, wee Mannie milked big, big Coo, and the weary, weary lady with
    the golden hair hushed her weeping and got her sup o' milk, and the
    fine, fine laddie new come from the wars put by his sharp, sharp
    sword, and all went well that didn't go ill.</p>

    <h2>Habetrot and Scantlie Mab</h2>
    <br />

    <p>A woman had one fair daughter, who loved play better than work,
    wandering in the meadows and lanes better than the spinning-wheel and
    distaff. The mother was heartily vexed at this, for in those days no
    lassie had any chance of a good husband unless she was an industrious
    spinster. So she coaxed, threatened, even beat her daughter, but all
    to no purpose; the girl remained what her mother called her, "an idle
    cuttie."</p>
    <p>At last, one spring morning, the gudewife gave her seven heads of
    lint, saying she would take no excuse; they must be returned in three
    days spun into yarn. The girl saw her mother was in earnest, so she
    plied her distaff as well as she could; but her hands were all
    untaught, and by the evening of the second day only a very small part
    of her task was done. She cried herself to sleep that night, and in
    the morning, throwing aside her work in despair, she strolled out into
    the fields, all sparkling with dew. At last she reached a knoll, at
    whose feet ran a little burn, shaded with woodbine and wild roses; and
    there she sat down, burying her face in her hands. When she looked up,
    she was surprised to see by the margin of the stream an old woman,
    quite unknown to her, drawing out the thread as she basked in the sun.
    There was nothing very remarkable in her appearance, except the length
    and thickness of her lips, only she was seated on a self-bored stone.
    The girl rose, went to the good dame, and gave her a friendly
    greeting, but could not help inquiring "What makes you so long
    lipped?"</p>
    <p>"Spinning thread, my hinnie," said the old woman, pleased with her.
    "I wet my fingers with my lips, as I draw the thread from the
    distaff."</p>
    <p>"Ah!" said the girl, "I should be spinning too, but it's all to no
    purpose. I shall ne'er do my task:" on which the old woman proposed to
    do it for her. Overjoyed, the maiden ran to fetch her lint, and placed
    it in her new friend's hand, asking where she should call for the yarn
    in the evening; but she received no reply; the old woman passed away
    from her among the trees and bushes. The girl, much bewildered,
    wandered about a little, sat down to rest, and finally fell asleep by
    the little knoll.</p>
    <p>When she awoke she was surprised to find that it was evening.
    Causleen, the evening star, was beaming with silvery light, soon to be
    lost in the moon's splendour. While watching these changes, the maiden
    was startled by the sound of an uncouth voice, which seemed to issue
    from below the self-bored stone, close beside her. She laid her ear to
    the stone and heard the words: "Hurry up, Scantlie Mab, for I've
    promised the yarn and Habetrot always keeps her promise." Then looking
    down the hole saw her friend, the old dame, walking backwards and
    forwards in a deep cavern among a group of spinsters all seated on
    colludie stones, and busy with distaff and spindle. An ugly company
    they were, with lips more or less disfigured, like old Habetrot's.
    Another of the sisterhood, who sat in a distant corner reeling the
    yarn, was marked, in addition, by grey eyes, which seemed starting
    from her head, and a long hooked nose.</p>
    <p>While the girl was still watching, she heard Habetrot address this
    dame by the name of Scantlie Mab, and say, "Bundle up the yarn, it is
    time the young lassie should give it to her mother." Delighted to hear
    this, the girl got up and returned homewards. Habetrot soon overtook
    her, and placed the yarn in her hands. "Oh, what can I do for ye in
    return?" exclaimed she, in delight. "Nothing&mdash;nothing," replied
    the dame; "but dinna tell your mother who spun the yarn."</p>
    <p>Scarcely believing her eyes, the girl went home, where she found
    her mother had been busy making sausters, and hanging them up in the
    chimney to dry, and then, tired out, had retired to rest. Finding
    herself very hungry after her long day on the knoll, the girl took
    down pudding after pudding, fried and ate them, and at last went to
    bed too. The mother was up first the next morning, and when she came
    into the kitchen and found her sausters all gone, and the seven hanks
    of yarn lying beautifully smooth and bright upon the table, she ran
    out of the house wildly, crying out&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"My daughter's spun seven, seven,
    seven,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>My daughter's eaten seven, seven,
    seven,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 4em;'>And all before
    daylight."</span><br />

    <p>A laird who chanced to be riding by, heard the exclamation, but
    could not understand it; so he rode up and asked the gudewife what was
    the matter, on which she broke out again&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"My daughter's spun seven, seven,
    seven,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>My daughter's eaten seven, seven,
    seven</span><br />

    <p>before daylight; and if ye dinna believe me, why come in and see
    it." The laird, he alighted and went into the cottage, where he saw
    the yarn, and admired it so much he begged to see the spinner.</p>
    <p>The mother dragged in her girl. He vowed he was lonely without a
    wife, and had long been in search of one who was a good spinner. So
    their troth was plighted, and the wedding took place soon afterwards,
    though the bride was in great fear that she should not prove so clever
    at her spinning-wheel as he expected. But old Dame Habetrot came to
    her aid. "Bring your bonny bridegroom to my cell," said she to the
    young bride soon after her marriage; "he shall see what comes o'
    spinning, and never will he tie you to the spinning-wheel."</p>
    <p>Accordingly the bride led her husband the next day to the flowery
    knoll, and bade him look through the self-bored stone. Great was his
    surprise to behold Habetrot dancing and jumping over her rock, singing
    all the time this ditty to her sisterhood, while they kept time with
    their spindles:&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"We who live in dreary

       border='0' />
    </center>
    <p>The song ended, Scantlie Mab asked Habetrot what she meant by the
    last line, "Unseen by all but we alone."</p>
    <p>"There is one," replied Habetrot, "whom I bid to come here at this
    hour, and he has heard my song through the self-bored stone." So
    saying she rose, opened another door, which was concealed by the roots
    of an old tree, and invited the pair to come in and see her
    family.</p>
    <p>The laird was astonished at the weird-looking company, as he well
    might be, and inquired of one after another the cause of their strange
    lips. In a different tone of voice, and with a different twist of the
    mouth, each answered that it was occasioned by spinning. At least they
    tried to say so, but one grunted out "Nakasind," and another
    "Owkasa&auml;nd," while a third murmured "O-a-a-send." All, however,
    made the bridegroom understand what was the cause of their ugliness;
    while Habetrot slily hinted that if his wife were allowed to spin, her
    pretty lips would grow out of shape too, and her pretty face get an
    ugsome look. So before he left the cave he vowed that his little wife
    should never touch a spinning-wheel, and he kept his word. She used to
    wander in the meadows by his side, or ride behind him over the hills,
    but all the flax grown on his land was sent to old Habetrot to be
    converted into yarn.</p>

    <h2>Catskin</h2>
    <br />

    <p>Well, there was once a gentleman who had fine lands and houses, and
    he very much wanted to have a son to be heir to them. So when his wife
    brought him a daughter, bonny as bonny could be, he cared nought for
    her, and said, "Let me never see her face."</p>
    <p>So she grew up a bonny girl, though her father never set eyes on
    her till she was fifteen years old and was ready to be married. But
    her father said, "Let her marry the first that comes for her." And
    when this was known, who should be first but a nasty rough old man. So
    she didn't know what to do, and went to the henwife and asked her
    advice. The henwife said, "Say you will not take him unless they give
    you a coat of silver cloth." Well, they gave her a coat of silver
    cloth, but she wouldn't take him for all that, but went again to the
    henwife, who said, "Say you will not take him unless they give you a
    coat of beaten gold." Well, they gave her a coat of beaten gold, but
    still she would not take him, but went to the henwife, who said, "Say
    you will not take him unless they give you a coat made of the feathers
    of all the birds of the air." So they sent a man with a great heap of
    pease; and the man cried to all the birds of the air, "Each bird take
    a pea, and put down a feather." So each bird took a pea and put down
    one of its feathers: and they took all the feathers and made a coat of
    them and gave it to her; but still she would not, but asked the
    henwife once again, who said, "Say they must first make you a coat of
    catskin." So they made her a coat of catskin; and she put it on, and
    tied up her other coats, and ran away into the woods.</p>
    <p>So she went along and went along and went along, till she came to
    the end of the wood, and saw a fine castle. So there she hid her fine
    dresses, and went up to the castle gates, and asked for work. The lady
    of the castle saw her, and told her, "I'm sorry I have no better
    place, but if you like you may be our scullion." So down she went into
    the kitchen, and they called her Catskin, because of her dress. But
    the cook was very cruel to her and led her a sad life.</p>
    <p>Well, it happened soon after that the young lord of the castle was
    coming home, and there was to be a grand ball in honour of the
    occasion. And when they were speaking about it among the servants,
    "Dear me, Mrs. Cook," said Catskin, "how much I should like to
    go."</p>
    <p>"What! you dirty impudent slut," said the cook, "you go among all
    the fine lords and ladies with your filthy catskin? a fine figure
    you'd cut!" and with that she took a basin of water and dashed it into
    Catskin's face. But she only briskly shook her ears, and said
    nothing.</p>
    <p>When the day of the ball arrived, Catskin slipped out of the house
    and went to the edge of the forest where she had hidden her dresses.
    So she bathed herself in a crystal waterfall, and then put on her coat
    of silver cloth, and hastened away to the ball. As soon as she entered
    all were overcome by her beauty and grace, while the young lord at
    once lost his heart to her. He asked her to be his partner for the
    first dance, and he would dance with none other the live-long
    night.</p>
    <p>When it came to parting time, the young lord said, "Pray tell me,
    fair maid, where you live." But Catskin curtsied and said:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Kind sir, if the truth I must
    tell,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>At the sign of the 'Basin of Water' I
    dwell."</span><br />

    <p>Then she flew from the castle and donned her catskin robe again,
    and slipped into the scullery again, unbeknown to the cook.</p>
    <p>The young lord went the very next day to his mother, the lady of
    the castle, and declared he would wed none other but the lady of the
    silver dress, and would never rest till he had found her. So another
    ball was soon arranged for in hope that the beautiful maid would
    appear again. So Catskin said to the cook, "Oh, how I should like to
    go!" Whereupon the cook screamed out in a rage, "What, you, you dirty
    impudent slut! you would cut a fine figure among all the fine lords
    and ladies." And with that she up with a ladle and broke it across
    Catskin's back. But she only shook her ears, and ran off to the
    forest, where she first of all bathed, and then put on her coat of
    beaten gold, and off she went to the ball-room.</p>
    <p>As soon as she entered all eyes were upon her; and the young lord
    soon recognised her as the lady of the "Basin of Water," and claimed
    her hand for the first dance, and did not leave her till the last.
    When that came, he again asked her where she lived. But all that she
    would say was:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Kind sir, if the truth I must
    tell,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>At the sign of the 'Broken Ladle' I
    dwell."</span><br />

    <p>and with that she curtsied, and flew from the ball, off with her
    golden robe, on with her catskin, and into the scullery without the
    cook's knowing.</p>
    <p>Next day when the young lord could not find where was the sign of
    the "Basin of Water," or of the "Broken Ladle," he begged his mother
    to have another grand ball, so that he might meet the beautiful maid
    once more.</p>
    <p>All happened as before. Catskin told the cook how much she would
    like to go to the ball, the cook called her "a dirty slut," and broke
    the skimmer across her head. But she only shook her ears, and went off
    to the forest, where she first bathed in the crystal spring, and then
    donned her coat of feathers, and so off to the ball-room.</p>
    <p>When she entered every one was surprised at so beautiful a face and
    form dressed in so rich and rare a dress; but the young lord soon
    recognised his beautiful sweetheart, and would dance with none but her
    the whole evening. When the ball came to an end, he pressed her to
    tell him where she lived, but all she would answer was:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Kind sir, if the truth I must
    tell,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>At the sign of the 'Broken Skimmer' I
    dwell;"</span><br />

    <p>and with that she curtsied, and was off to the forest. But this
    time the young lord followed her, and watched her change her fine
    dress of feathers for her catskin dress, and then he knew her for his
    own scullery-maid.</p>

    alt='"So he went and gave it, but put it into the hand of the woman&rsquo;s child, who leant forward and kissed the little lord."'
     border='0' />
    <p>Next day he went to his mother, the lady of the castle, and told
    her that he wished to marry the scullery-maid, Catskin. "Never," said
    the lady, and rushed from the room. Well, the young lord was so
    grieved at that, that he took to his bed and was very ill. The doctor
    tried to cure him, but he would not take any medicine unless from the
    hands of Catskin. So the doctor went to the lady of the castle, and
    told her her son would die if she did not consent to his marriage with
    Catskin. So she had to give way, and summoned Catskin to her. But she
    put on her coat of beaten gold, and went to the lady, who soon was
    glad to wed her son to so beautiful a maid.</p>
    <p>Well, so they were married, and after a time a dear little son came
    to them, and grew up a bonny lad; and one day, when he was four years
    old, a beggar woman came to the door, so Lady Catskin gave some money
    to the little lord and told him to go and give it to the beggar woman.
    So he went and gave it, but put it into the hand of the woman's child,
    who leant forward and kissed the little lord. Now the wicked old
    cook&mdash;why hadn't she been sent away?&mdash;was looking on, so she
    said, "Only see how beggars' brats take to one another." This insult
    went to Catskin's heart, so she went to her husband, the young lord,
    and told him all about her father, and begged he would go and find out
    what had become of her parents. So they set out in the lord's grand
    coach, and travelled through the forest till they came to Catskin's
    father's house, and put up at an inn near, where Catskin stopped,
    while her husband went to see if her father would own her.</p>
    <p>Now her father had never had any other child, and his wife had
    died; so he was all alone in the world and sate moping and miserable.
    When the young lord came in he hardly looked up, till he saw a chair
    close up to him, and asked him: "Pray, sir, had you not once a young
    daughter whom you would never see or own?"</p>
    <p>The old gentleman said: "It is true; I am a hardened sinner. But I
    would give all my worldly goods if I could but see her once before I
    die." Then the young lord told him what had happened to Catskin, and
    took him to the inn, and brought his father-in-law to his own castle,
    where they lived happy ever afterwards.</p>

    <h2>Stupid's Cries</h2>
    <br />

    <p>There was once a little boy, and his mother sent him to buy a
    sheep's head and pluck; afraid he should forget it, the lad kept
    saying all the way along:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Sheep's head and
    pluck!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Sheep's head and pluck!"</span><br />

    <p>Trudging along, he came to a stile; but in getting over he fell and
    hurt himself, and beginning to blubber, forgot what he was sent for.
    So he stood a little while to consider: at last he thought he
    recollected it, and began to repeat:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Liver and lights and gall and
    all!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Liver and lights and gall and
    all!"</span><br />

    <p>Away he went again, and came to where a man had a pain in his
    liver, bawling out:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Liver and lights and gall and
    all!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Liver and lights and gall and
    all!"</span><br />

    <p>Whereon the man laid hold of him and beat him, bidding him say:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Pray God send no more!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Pray God send no more!"</span><br />

    <p>The youngster strode along, uttering these words, till he reached a
    field where a hind was sowing wheat:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Pray God send no more!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Pray God send no more!"</span><br />

    <p>This was all his cry. So the sower began to thrash him, and charged
    him to repeat:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Pray God send plenty
    more!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Pray God send plenty
    more!"</span><br />

    <p>Off the child scampered with these words in his mouth till he
    reached a churchyard and met a funeral, but he went on with his:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Pray God send plenty
    more!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Pray God send plenty
    more!"</span><br />

    <p>The chief mourner seized and punished him, and bade him repeat:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Pray God send the soul to
    heaven!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Pray God send the soul to
    heaven!"</span><br />

    <p>Away went the boy, and met a dog and a cat going to be hung, but
    his cry rang out:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Pray God send the soul to
    heaven!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Pray God send the soul to

    <p>The good folk nearly were furious, seized and struck him, charging
    him to say:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"A dog and a cat agoing to be
    hung!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A dog and a cat agoing to be
    hung!"</span><br />

    <p>This the poor fellow did, till he overtook a man and a woman going
    to be married. "Oh! oh!" he shouted:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"A dog and a cat agoing to be
    hung!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A dog and a cat agoing to be
    hung!"</span><br />

    <p>The man was enraged, as we may well think, gave him many a thump,
    and ordered him to repeat:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"I wish you much joy!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>I wish you much joy!"</span><br />

    <p>This he did, jogging along, till he came to two labourers who had
    fallen into a ditch. The lad kept bawling out:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"I wish you much joy!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>I wish you much joy!"</span><br />

    <p>This vexed one of the folk so sorely that he used all his strength,
    scrambled out, beat the crier, and told him to say.</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"The one is out, I wish the other
    was!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The one is out, I wish the other
    was!"</span><br />

    <p>On went young 'un till he found a fellow with only one eye; but he
    kept up his song:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"The one is out, I wish the other
    was!</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The one is out, I wish the other

    <p>This was too much for Master One-eye, who grabbed him and chastised
    him, bidding him call:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"The one side gives good light, I

     <span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The one side gives good light, I wish

    <p>So he did, to be sure, till he came to a house, one side of which
    was on fire. The people here thought it was he who had set the place
    a-blazing, and straightway put him in prison. The end was, the judge
    put on his black cap, and condemned him to die.</p>

    <a id="The_Lambton_Worm" name='The_Lambton_Worm'></a>
    <h2>The Lambton Worm</h2>
    <br />

    <p>A wild young fellow was the heir of Lambton, the fine estate and
    hall by the side of the swift-flowing Wear. Not a Mass would he hear
    in Brugeford Chapel of a Sunday, but a-fishing he would go. And if he
    did not haul in anything, his curses could be heard by the folk as
    they went by to Brugeford.</p>
    <p>Well, one Sunday morning he was fishing as usual, and not a salmon
    had risen to him, his basket was bare of roach or dace. And the worse
    his luck, the worse grew his language, till the passers-by were
    horrified at his words as they went to listen to the Mass-priest.</p>
    <p>At last young Lambton felt a mighty tug at his line. "At last,"
    quoth he, "a bite worth having!" and he pulled and he pulled, till
    what should appear above the water but a head like an elf's, with nine
    holes on each side of its mouth. But still he pulled till he had got
    the thing to land, when it turned out to be a Worm of hideous shape.
    If he had cursed before, his curses were enough to raise the hair on
    your head.</p>
    <p>"What ails thee, my son?" said a voice by his side, "and what hast
    thou caught, that thou shouldst stain the Lord's Day with such foul
    language?"</p>
    <p>Looking round, young Lambton saw a strange old man standing by
    him.</p>
    <p>"Why, truly," he said, "I think I have caught the devil himself.
    Look you and see if you know him."</p>
    <p>But the stranger shook his head, and said, "It bodes no good to
    thee or thine to bring such a monster to shore. Yet cast him not back
    into the Wear; thou has caught him, and thou must keep him," and with
    that away he turned, and was seen no more.</p>
    <p>The young heir of Lambton took up the gruesome thing, and, taking
    it off his hook, cast it into a well close by, and ever since that day
    that well has gone by the name of the Worm Well.</p>
    <p>For some time nothing more was seen or heard of the Worm, till one
    day it had outgrown the size of the well, and came forth full-grown.
    So it came forth from the well and betook itself to the Wear. And all
    day long it would lie coiled round a rock in the middle of the stream,
    while at night it came forth from the river and harried the country
    side. It sucked the cows' milk, devoured the lambs, worried the
    cattle, and frightened all the women and girls of the district, and
    then it would retire for the rest of the night to the hill, still
    called the Worm Hill, on the north side of the Wear, about a mile and
    a half from Lambton Hall.</p>
    <p>This terrible visitation brought young Lambton, of Lambton Hall, to
    his senses. He took upon himself the vows of the Cross, and departed
    for the Holy Land, in the hope that the scourge he had brought upon
    his district would disappear. But the grisly Worm took no heed, except
    that it crossed the river and came right up to Lambton Hall itself
    where the old lord lived on all alone, his only son having gone to the
    Holy Land. What to do? The Worm was coming closer and closer to the
    Hall; women were shrieking, men were gathering weapons, dogs were
    barking and horses neighing with terror. At last the steward called
    out to the dairy maids, "Bring all your milk hither," and when they
    did so, and had brought all the milk that the nine kye of the byre had
    yielded, he poured it all into the long stone trough in front of the
    Hall.</p>
    <p>The Worm drew nearer and nearer, till at last it came up to the
    trough. But when it sniffed the milk, it turned aside to the trough
    and swallowed all the milk up, and then slowly turned round and
    crossed the river Wear, and coiled its bulk three times round the Worm
    Hill for the night.</p>
    <p>Henceforth the Worm would cross the river every day, and woe betide
    the Hall if the trough contained the milk of less than nine kye. The
    Worm would hiss, and would rave, and lash its tail round the trees of
    the park, and in its fury it would uproot the stoutest oaks and the
    loftiest firs. So it went on for seven years. Many tried to destroy
    the Worm, but all had failed, and many a knight had lost his life in
    fighting with the monster, which slowly crushed the life out of all
    that came near it.</p>
    <p>At last the Childe of Lambton came home to his father's Hall, after
    seven long years spent in meditation and repentance on holy soil. Sad
    and desolate he found his folk: the lands untilled, the farms
    deserted, half the trees of the park uprooted, for none would stay to
    tend the nine kye that the monster needed for his food each day.</p>
    <p>The Childe sought his father, and begged his forgiveness for the
    curse he had brought on the Hall.</p>
    <p>"Thy sin is pardoned," said his father; "but go thou to the Wise
    Woman of Brugeford, and find if aught can free us from this
    monster."</p>
    <p>To the Wise Woman went the Childe, and asked her advice.</p>
    <p>"'T is thy fault, O Childe, for which we suffer," she said; "be it
    thine to release us."</p>
    <p>"I would give my life," said the Childe.</p>
    <p>"Mayhap thou wilt do so," said she. "But hear me, and mark me well.
    Thou, and thou alone, canst kill the Worm. But, to this end, go thou
    to the smithy and have thy armour studded with spear-heads. Then go to
    the Worm's Rock in the Wear, and station thyself there. Then, when the
    Worm comes to the Rock at dawn of day, try thy prowess on him, and God
    gi'e thee a good deliverance."</p>
    <p>"This I will do," said Childe Lambton.</p>
    <p>"But one thing more," said the Wise Woman, going back to her cell.
    "If thou slay the Worm, swear that thou wilt put to death the first
    thing that meets thee as thou crossest again the threshold of Lambton
    Hall. Do this, and all will be well with thee and thine. Fulfil not
    thou vow, and none of the Lambtons, for generations three times three,
    shall die in his bed. Swear, and fail not."</p>
    <p>The Childe swore as the Wise Woman bid, and went his way to the
    smithy. There he had his armour studded with spear-heads all over.
    Then he passed his vigils in Brugeford Chapel, and at dawn of day took
    his post on the Worm's Rock in the River Wear.</p>
    <p>As dawn broke, the Worm uncoiled its snaky twine from around the
    hill, and came to its rock in the river. When it perceived the Childe
    waiting for it, it lashed the waters in its fury and wound its coils
    round the Childe, and then attempted to crush him to death. But the
    more it pressed, the deeper dug the spear-heads into its sides. Still
    it pressed and pressed, till all the water around was crimsoned with
    its blood. Then the Worm unwound itself, and left the Childe free to
    use his sword. He raised it, brought it down, and cut the Worm in two.
    One half fell into the river, and was carried swiftly away. Once more
    the head and the remainder of the body encircled the Childe, but with
    less force, and the spear-heads did their work. At last the Worm
    uncoiled itself, snorted its last foam of blood and fire, and rolled
    dying into the river, and was never seen more.</p>

    <br />

    <p>The Childe of Lambton swam ashore, and raising his bugle to his
    lips, sounded its note thrice. This was the signal to the Hall, where
    the servants and the old lord had shut themselves in to pray for the
    Childe's success. When the third sound of the bugle was heard, they
    were to release Boris, the Childe's favourite hound. But such was
    their joy at learning of the Childe's safety and the Worm's defeat,
    that they forgot orders, and when the Childe reached the threshold of
    the Hall his old father rushed out to meet him, and would have clasped
    him to his breast.</p>
    <p>"The vow! the vow!" cried out the Childe of Lambton, and blew still
    another blast upon his horn. This time the servants remembered, and
    released Boris, who came bounding to his young master. The Childe
    raised his shining sword, and severed the head of his faithful
    hound.</p>
    <p>But the vow was broken, and for nine generations of men none of the
    Lambtons died in his bed. The last of the Lambtons died in his
    carriage as he was crossing Brugeford Bridge, one hundred and thirty
    years ago.</p>

      <i>Of Buying of Sheep</i>
    </center>
    <p>There were two men of Gotham, and one of them was going to market
    to Nottingham to buy sheep, and the other came from the market, and
    they both met together upon Nottingham bridge.</p>
    <p>"Where are you going?" said the one who came from Nottingham.</p>
    <p>"Marry," said he that was going to Nottingham, "I am going to buy
    sheep."</p>
    <p>"Buy sheep?" said the other, "and which way will you bring them
    home?"</p>
    <p>"Marry," said the other, "I will bring them over this bridge."</p>
    <p>"By Robin Hood," said he that came from Nottingham, "but thou shalt
    not."</p>
    <p>"By Maid Marion," said he that was going thither, "but I will."</p>
    <p>"You will not," said the one.</p>
    <p>"I will."</p>
    <p>Then they beat their staves against the ground one against the
    other, as if there had been a hundred sheep between them.</p>
    <p>"Hold in," said one; "beware lest my sheep leap over the
    bridge."</p>
    <p>"I care not," said the other; "they shall not come this way."</p>
    <p>"But they shall," said the other.</p>
    <p>Then the other said: "If that thou make much to do, I will put my
    fingers in thy mouth."</p>
    <p>"Will you?" said the other.</p>
    <p>Now, as they were at their contention, another man of Gotham came
    from the market with a sack of meal upon a horse, and seeing and
    hearing his neighbours at strife about sheep, though there were none
    between them, said:</p>
    <p>"Ah, fools! will you ever learn wisdom? Help me, and lay my sack
    upon my shoulders."</p>
    <p>They did so, and he went to the side of the bridge, unloosened the
    mouth of the sack, and shook all his meal out into the river.</p>
    <p>"Now, neighbours," he said, "how much meal is there in my
    sack?"</p>
    <p>"Marry," said they, "there is none at all."</p>
    <p>"Now, by my faith," said he, "even as much wit as is in your two
    heads to stir up strife about a thing you have not."</p>
    <p>Which was the wisest of these three persons, judge yourself.</p>

      <i>Of Hedging a Cuckoo</i>

    <p>Once upon a time the men of Gotham would have kept the Cuckoo so
    that she might sing all the year, and in the midst of their town they
    made a hedge round in compass and they got a Cuckoo, and put her into
    it, and said, "Sing there all through the year, or thou shalt have
    neither meat nor water." The Cuckoo, as soon as she perceived herself
    within the hedge, flew away. "A vengeance on her!" said they. "We did
    not make our hedge high enough."</p>

    <p>There was a man of Gotham who went to the market at Nottingham to
    sell cheese, and as he was going down the hill to Nottingham bridge,
    one of his cheeses fell out of his wallet and rolled down the hill.
    "Ah, gaffer," said the fellow, "can you run to market alone? I will
    send one after another after you."</p>
    <p>Then he laid down his wallet and took out the cheeses, and rolled
    them down the hill. Some went into one bush; and some went into
    another.</p>
    <p>"I charge you all to meet me near the market-place;" and when the
    fellow came to the market to meet his cheeses, he stayed there till
    the market was nearly done. Then he went about to inquire of his
    friends and neighbours, and other men, if they did see his cheeses
    come to the market.</p>
    <p>"Who should bring them?" said one of the market men.</p>
    <p>"Marry, themselves," said the fellow; "they know the way well
    enough."</p>
    <p>He said, "A vengeance on them all. I did fear, to see them run so
    fast, that they would run beyond the market. I am now fully persuaded
    that they must be now almost at York." Whereupon he forthwith hired a
    horse to ride to York, to seek his cheeses where they were not, but to
    this day no man can tell him of his cheeses.</p>

      <i>Of Drowning Eels</i>
    </center>
    <p>When Good Friday came, the men of Gotham cast their heads together
    what to do with their white herrings, their red herrings, their
    sprats, and other salt fish. One consulted with the other, and agreed
    that such fish should be cast into their pond (which was in the middle
    of the town), that they might breed against the next year, and every
    man that had salt fish left cast them into the pool.</p>
    <p>"I have many white herrings," said one.</p>
    <p>"I have many sprats," said another.</p>
    <p>"I have many red herrings," said the other.</p>
    <p>"I have much salt fish. Let all go into the pond or pool, and we
    shall fare like lords next year."</p>
    <p>At the beginning of next year following the men drew near the pond
    to have their fish, and there was nothing but a great eel. "Ah," said
    they all, "a mischief on this eel, for he has eaten up all our
    fish."</p>
    <p>"What shall we do to him?" said one to the others.</p>
    <p>"Kill him," said one.</p>
    <p>"Chop him into pieces," said another. "Not so," said another; "let
    us drown him."</p>
    <p>"Be it so," said all. And they went to another pond, and cast the
    eel into the pond. "Lie there and shift for yourself, for no help thou
    shalt have from us;" and they left the eel to drown.</p>

      <i>Of Sending Rent</i>
    </center>
    <p>Once on a time the men of Gotham had forgotten to pay their
    landlord. One said to the other, "To-morrow is our pay-day, and what
    shall we find to send our money to our landlord?"</p>
    <p>The one said, "This day I have caught a hare, and he shall carry
    it, for he is light of foot."</p>
    <p>"Be it so," said all; "he shall have a letter and a purse to put
    our money in, and we shall direct him the right way." So when the
    letters were written and the money put in a purse, they tied it round
    the hare's neck, saying, "First you go to Lancaster, then thou must go
    to Loughborough, and Newarke is our landlord, and commend us to him
    and there is his dues."</p>

    height='238' align='right' alt='A Wise Man' border='0' />
    <p>The hare, as soon as he was out of their hands, ran on along the
    country way. Some cried, "Thou must go to Lancaster first."</p>
    <p>"Let the hare alone," said another; "he can tell a nearer way than
    the best of us all. Let him go."</p>
    <p>Another said, "It is a subtle hare, let her alone; she will not
    keep the highway for fear of dogs."</p>

      <i>Of Counting</i>
    </center>
    <p>On a certain time there were twelve men of Gotham who went fishing,
    and some went into the water and some on dry ground; and, as they were
    coming back, one of them said, "We have ventured much this day wading;
    I pray God that none of us that did come from home be drowned."</p>
    <p>"Marry," said one, "let us see about that. Twelve of us came out,"
    and every man did count eleven, and the twelfth man did never count
    himself.</p>
    <p>"Alas!" said one to another, "one of us is drowned." They went back
    to the brook where they had been fishing, and looked up and down for
    him that was drowned, and made great lamentation. A courtier came
    riding by, and he did ask what they were seeking, and why they were so
    sorrowful. "Oh," said they, "this day we came to fish in this brook,
    and there were twelve of us, and one is drowned."</p>
    <p>"Why," said the courtier, "count me how many of you there be," and
    one counted eleven and did not count himself. "Well," said the
    courtier, "what will you give me if I find the twelfth man?"</p>
    <p>"Sir," said they, "all the money we have."</p>
    <p>"Give me the money," said the courtier; and he began with the
    first, and gave him a whack over the shoulders that he groaned, and
    said, "There is one," and he served all of them that they groaned; but
    when he came to the last he gave him a good blow, saying, "Here is the
    twelfth man."</p>
    <p>"God bless you on your heart," said all the company; "you have
    found our neighbour."</p>

    <a id="Princess_of_Canterbury" name='Princess_of_Canterbury'></a>
    <h2>Princess of Canterbury</h2>
    <br />

    <p>There lived formerly in the County of Cumberland a nobleman who had
    three sons, two of whom were comely and clever youths, but the other a
    natural fool, named Jack, who was generally engaged with the sheep: he
    was dressed in a parti-coloured coat, and a steeple-crowned hat with a
    tassel, as became his condition. Now the King of Canterbury had a
    beautiful daughter, who was distinguished by her great ingenuity and
    wit, and he issued a decree that whoever should answer three questions
    put to him by the princess should have her in marriage, and be heir to
    the crown at his decease. Shortly after this decree was published,
    news of it reached the ears of the nobleman's sons, and the two clever
    ones determined to have a trial, but they were sadly at a loss to
    prevent their idiot brother from going with them. They could not, by
    any means, get rid of him, and were compelled at length to let Jack
    accompany them. They had not gone far, before Jack shrieked with
    laughter, saying, "I've found an egg." "Put it in your pocket," said
    the brothers. A little while afterwards, he burst out into another fit
    of laughter on finding a crooked hazel stick, which he also put in his
    pocket; and a third time he again laughed extravagantly because he
    found a nut. That also was put with his other treasures.</p>
    <p>When they arrived at the palace, they were immediately admitted on
    mentioning the nature of their business, and were ushered into a room
    where the princess and her suite were sitting. Jack, who never stood
    on ceremony, bawled out, "What a troop of fair ladies we've got
    here!"</p>
    <p>"Yes," said the princess, "we are fair ladies, for we carry fire in
    our bosoms."</p>
    <p>"Do you?" said Jack, "then roast me an egg," pulling out the egg
    from his pocket.</p>
    <p>"How will you get it out again?" said the princess.</p>
    <p>"With a crooked stick," replied Jack, producing the hazel.</p>
    <p>"Where did that come from?" said the princess.</p>
    <p>"From a nut," answered Jack, pulling out the nut from his pocket.
    "I've answered the three questions, and now I'll have the lady." "No,
    no," said the king, "not so fast. You have still an ordeal to go
    through. You must come here in a week's time and watch for one whole
    night with the princess, my daughter. If you can manage to keep awake
    the whole night long you shall marry her next day."</p>
    <p>"But if I can't?" said Jack.</p>
    <p>"Then off goes your head," said the king. "But you need not try
    unless you like."</p>
    <p>Well, Jack went back home for a week, and thought over whether he
    should try and win the princess. At last he made up his mind. "Well,"
    said Jack, "I'll try my vorton; zo now vor the king's daughter, or a
    headless shepherd!"</p>
    <p>And taking his bottle and bag, he trudged to the court. In his way
    thither, he was obliged to cross a river, and pulling off his shoes
    and stockings, while he was passing over he observed several pretty
    fish bobbing against his feet; so he caught some and put them into his
    pocket. When he reached the palace he knocked at the gate loudly with
    his crook, and having mentioned the object of his visit, he was
    immediately conducted to the hall where the king's daughter sat ready
    prepared to see her lovers. He was placed in a luxurious chair, and
    rich wines and spices were set before him, and all sorts of delicate
    meats. Jack, unused to such fare, ate and drank plentifully, so that
    he was nearly dozing before midnight.</p>
    <p>"Oh, shepherd," said the lady, "I have caught you napping!"</p>
    <p>"Noa, sweet ally, I was busy a-feeshing."</p>
    <p>"A fishing," said the princess in the utmost astonishment: "Nay,
    shepherd, there is no fish-pond in the hall."</p>
    <p>"No matter vor that, I have been fishing in my pocket, and have
    just caught one."</p>
    <p>"Oh me!" said she, "let me see it."</p>
    <p>The shepherd slyly drew the fish out of his pocket and pretending
    to have caught it, showed it her, and she declared it was the finest
    she ever saw.</p>
    <p>About half an hour afterwards, she said, "Shepherd, do you think
    you could get me one more?"</p>
    <p>He replied, "Mayhap I may, when I have baited my hook;" and after a
    little while he brought out another, which was finer than the first,
    and the princess was so delighted that she gave him leave to go to
    sleep, and promised to excuse him to her father.</p>
    <p>In the morning the princess told the king, to his great
    astonishment, that Jack must not be beheaded, for he had been fishing
    in the hall all night; but when he heard how Jack had caught such
    beautiful fish out of his pocket, he asked him to catch one in his
    own.</p>
    <p>Jack readily undertook the task, and bidding the king lie down, he
    pretended to fish in his pocket, having another fish concealed ready
    in his hand, and giving him a sly prick with a needle, he held up the
    fish, and showed it to the king.</p>
    <p>His majesty did not much relish the operation, but he assented to
    the marvel of it, and the princess and Jack were united the same day,
    and lived for many years in happiness and prosperity.</p>

    <h2>Notes and References</h2>
    <br />

    <p>For some general remarks on the English Folk-Tale and previous
    collectors, I must refer to the introductory observations added to the
    Notes and References of <i>English Fairy Tales</i>, in the third
    edition. With the present instalment the tale of English Fairy Stories
    that are likely to obtain currency among the young folk is complete. I
    do not know of more than half-a-dozen "outsiders" that deserve to rank
    with those included in my two volumes which, for the present, at any
    rate, must serve as the best substitute that can be offered for an
    English Grimm. I do not despair of the future. After what Miss Fison
    (who, as I have recently learned, was the collector of <i>Tom Tit
    Tot</i> and <i>Cap o' Rushes</i>), Mrs. Balfour, and Mrs. Gomme have
    done in the way of collecting among the folk, we may still hope for
    substantial additions to our stock to be garnered by ladies from the
    less frequented portions of English soil. And from the United States
    we have every reason to expect a rich harvest to be gathered by Mr.
    W.W. Newell, who is collecting the English folk-tales that still
    remain current in New England. If his forthcoming book equals in
    charm, scholarship, and thoroughness his delightful <i>Games and Songs
    of American Children</i>, the Anglo-American folk-tale will be
    enriched indeed. A further examination of English nursery rhymes may
    result in some additions to our stock. I reserve these for separate
    treatment in which I am especially interested, owing to the relations
    which I surmise between the folk-tale and the <i>cante-fable</i>.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the eighty-seven tales (representing some hundred and
    twenty variants) in my two volumes must represent the English
    folk-tale as far as my diligence has been able to preserve it at this
    end of the nineteenth century. There is every indication that they
    form but a scanty survival of the whole <i>corpus</i> of such tales
    which must have existed in this country. Of the seventy European
    story-radicles which I have enumerated in the Folk-Lore Society's
    <i>Handbook</i>, pp. 117-35, only forty are represented in our
    collection: I have little doubt that the majority of the remaining
    thirty or so also existed in these isles, and especially in England.
    If I had reckoned in the tales current in the English pale of Ireland,
    as well as those in Lowland Scots, there would have been even less
    missing. The result of my investigations confirms me in my impression
    that the scope of the English folk-tale should include all those
    current among the folk in English, no matter where spoken, in Ireland,
    the Lowlands, New England, or Australia. Wherever there is community
    of language, tales can spread, and it is more likely that tales should
    be preserved in those parts where English is spoken with most of
    dialect. Just as the Anglo-Irish Pale preserves more of the
    pronunciation of Shakespeare's time, so it is probable that
    Anglo-Irish stories preserve best those current in Shakespeare's time
    in English. On the other hand, it is possible that some, nay many, of
    the Anglo-Irish stories have been imported from the Celtic districts,
    and are positively folk-translations from the Gaelic. Further research
    is required to determine which is English and which Celtic among
    Anglo-Irish folk-tales. Meanwhile my collection must stand for the
    nucleus of the English folk-tale, and we can at any rate judge of its
    general spirit and tendencies from the eighty-seven tales now before
    the reader.</p>
    <p>Of these, thirty-eight are <i>m&auml;rchen</i> proper, <i>i.e.</i>,
    tales with definite plot and evolution; ten are sagas or legends
    locating romantic stories in definite localities; no less than
    nineteen are drolls or comic anecdotes; four are cumulative stories:
    six beast tales; while ten are merely ingenious nonsense tales put
    together in such a form as to amuse children. The preponderance of the
    comic element is marked, and it is clear that humour is a
    characteristic of the English <i>folk</i>. The legends are not of a
    very romantic kind, and the <i>m&auml;rchen</i> are often humorous in
    character. So that a certain air of unromance is given by such a
    collection as that we are here considering. The English folk-muse
    wears homespun and plods afoot, albeit with a cheerful smile and a
    steady gaze.</p>
    <p>Some of this effect is produced by the manner in which the tales
    are told. The colloquial manner rarely rises to the dignified, and the
    essence of the folk-tale manner in English is colloquial. The opening
    formul&aelig; are varied enough, but none of them has much play of
    fancy. "Once upon a time and a very good time it was, though it wasn't
    in my time nor in your time nor in any one else's time," is effective
    enough for a fairy epoch, and is common, according to Mayhew
    (<i>London Labour</i>. iii.), among tramps. We have the rhyming
    formula:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Once upon a time when pigs spoke
    rhyme,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>And monkeys chewed
    tobacco,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>And hens took snuff to make them
    tough,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>And ducks went quack, quack, quack
    Oh!</span><br />

    <p>on which I have variants not so refined. Some stories start off
    without any preliminary formula, or with a simple "Well, there was
    once a &mdash;&mdash;". A Scotch formula reported by Mrs. Balfour
    runs, "Once on a time when a' muckle folk were wee and a' lees were
    true," while Mr. Lang gives us "There was a king and a queen as mony
    ane's been, few have we seen and as few may we see." Endings of
    stories are even less varied. "So they married and lived happy ever
    afterwards," comes from folk-tales, not from novels. "All went well
    that didn't go ill," is a somewhat cynical formula given by Mrs.
    Balfour, while the Scotch have "they lived happy and died happy, and
    never drank out of a dry cappie."</p>
    <p>In the course of the tale the chief thing to be noticed is the
    occurrence of rhymes in the prose narrative, tending to give the
    appearance of a <i>cante-fable</i>. I have enumerated those occurring
    in <i>English Fairy Tales</i> in the notes to <i>Childe Rowland</i>
    (No. xxi.). In the present volume, rhyme occurs in Nos. xlvi.,
    xlviii., xlix., lviii., lx., lxiii. (see Note), lxiv., lxxiv., lxxxi.,
    lxxxv., while lv., lxix., lxxiii., lxxvi., lxxxiii., lxxxiv., are
    either in verse themselves or derived from verse versions. Altogether
    one third of our collection gives evidence in favour of the
    <i>cante-fable</i> theory which I adduced in my notes to <i>Childe
    Rowland</i>. Another point of interest in English folk-narrative is
    the repetition of verbs of motion, "So he went along and went along
    and went along." Still more curious is a frequent change of tense from
    the English present to the past. "So he gets up and went along." All
    this helps to give the colloquial and familiar air to the English
    fairy-tale not to mention the dialectal and archaic words and phrases
    which occur in them.</p>
    <p>But their very familiarity and colloquialism make them remarkably
    effective with English-speaking little ones. The rhythmical phrases
    stick in their memories; they can remember the exact phraseology of
    the English tales much better, I find, than that of the Grimms' tales,
    or even of the Celtic stories. They certainly have the quality of
    coming home to English children. Perhaps this may be partly due to the
    fact that a larger proportion of the tales are of native manufacture.
    If the researches contained in my Notes are to be trusted only i.-ix.,
    xi., xvii., xxii., xxv., xxvi., xxvii., xliv., l., liv., lv., lviii.,
    lxi., lxii., lxv., lxvii., lxxviii., lxxxiv., lxxxvii. were imported;
    nearly all the remaining sixty are home produce, and have their roots
    in the hearts of the English people which naturally respond to
    them.</p>
    <p>In the following Notes, I have continued my practice of giving (1)
    <i>Source</i> where I obtained the various tales. (2)
    <i>Parallels</i>, so far as possible, in full for the British Isles,
    with bibliographical references when they can be found; for
    occurrences abroad I generally refer to the list of incidents
    contained in my paper read before the International Folk-Lore Congress
    of 1891 and republished in the <i>Transactions</i>, 1892, pp. 87-98.
    (3) <i>Remarks</i> where the tale seems to need them. I have mainly
    been on the search for signs of diffusion rather than of "survivals"
    of antiquarian interest, though I trust it will be found I have not
    neglected these.</p>
    <br />

    <p>XLIV. THE PIED PIPER</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Abraham Elder, <i>Tales and Legends of the
    Isle of Wight</i> (London, 1839), pp. 157-164. Mr. Nutt, who has
    abridged and partly rewritten the story from a copy of Elder's book in
    his possession, has introduced a couple of touches from Browning.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The well-known story of the Pied Piper of
    Hameln (Hamelin), immortalised by Browning, will at once recur to
    every reader's mind. Before Browning, it had been told in English in
    books as well known as Verstegan's <i>Restitution of Decayed
    Intelligence</i>, 1605; Howell's <i>Familiar Letters</i> (see my
    edition, p. 357, <i>n.</i>); and Wanley's <i>Wonders of the Little
    World</i>. Browning is said to have taken it from the last source
    (Furnivall, <i>Browning Bibliography</i>, 158), though there are
    touches which seem to me to come from Howell (see my note <i>ad
    loc.</i>), while it is not impossible he may have come across Elder's
    book, which was illustrated by Cruikshank. The Grimms give the legend
    in their <i>Deutsche Sagen</i> (ed. 1816, 330-33), and in its native
    land it has given rise to an elaborate poem <i>&agrave; la</i>
    Scheffel by Julius Wolff, which has in its turn been the occasion of
    an opera by Victor Nessler. Mrs. Gutch, in an interesting study of the
    myth in <i>Folk-Lore</i> iii., pp. 227-52, quotes a poem, <i>The Sea
    Piece</i>, published by Dr. Kirkpatrick in 1750, as showing that a
    similar legend was told of the Cave Hill, Belfast.</p>

    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Mr. Baring-Gould, in his <i>Curious Myths of
    the Middle Ages</i>, has explained the Pied Piper as a wind myth. Mrs.
    Gutch is inclined to think there may be a substratum of fact at the
    root of the legend, basing her conclusions on a pamphlet of Dr.
    Meinardus, <i>Der historische Kern</i>, which I have not seen. She
    does not, however, give any well-authenticated historical event at
    Hameln in the thirteenth century which could have plausibly given rise
    to the legend, nor can I find any in the <i>Urkundenbuch</i> of Hameln
    (Luneberg, 1883). The chief question of interest attaching to the
    English form of the legend as given in 1839 by Elder, is whether it is
    independent of the German myth. It does not occur in any of the local
    histories of the Isle of Wight which I have been able to consult of a
    date previous to Elder's book&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, J. Hassel, <i>Tour of
    the Isle of Wight</i>, 1790. Mr. Shore, in his <i>History of
    Hampshire</i>, 1891, p. 185, refers to the legend, but evidently bases
    his reference on Elder, and so with all the modern references I have
    seen. Now Elder himself quotes Verstegan in his comments on the
    legend, pp. 168-9 and note, and it is impossible to avoid conjecturing
    that he adapted Verstegan to the locality. Newtown, when Hassel
    visited it in 1790, had only six or seven houses (<i>l.c.</i>, i.,
    137-8), though it had the privilege of returning two members to
    Parliament; it had been a populous town by the name of Franchville
    before the French invasion of the island of <i>temp.</i> Ric. II. It
    is just possible that there may have been a local legend to account
    for the depopulation by an exodus of the children. But the expression
    "pied piper" which Elder used clearly came from Verstegan, and until
    evidence is shown to the contrary the whole of the legend was adapted
    from him. It is not without significance that Elder was writing in the
    days of the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>, and had possibly no more
    foundation for the localisation of his stories than Barham.</p>
    <p>There still remains the curious parallel from Belfast to which Mrs.
    Gutch has drawn attention. Magic pipers are not unknown to English
    folk-lore, as in the Percy ballad of <i>The Frere and the Boy</i>, or
    in the nursery rhyme of Tom the Piper's son in its more extended form.
    But beguiling into a mountain is not known elsewhere except at Hameln,
    which was made widely known in England by Verstegan's and Howell's
    accounts, so that the Belfast variant is also probably to be traced to
    the <i>Rattenf&auml;nger</i>. Here again, as in the case of
    Beddgellert (<i>Celtic Fairy Tales</i>, No. xxi.), the Blinded Giant
    and the Pedlar of Swaffham (<i>infra</i>, Nos. lxi., lxiii.), we have
    an imported legend adapted to local conditions.</p>
    <br />

    <p>XLV. HEREAFTERTHIS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Sent me anonymously soon after the appearance
    of <i>English Fairy Tales</i>. From a gloss in the MS. "vitty" =
    Devonian for "decent," I conclude the tale is current in Devon. I
    should be obliged if the sender would communicate with me.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The latter part has a certain similarity
    with "Jack Hannaford" (No. viii.). Halliwell's story of the miser who
    kept his money "for luck" (p. 153) is of the same type. Halliwell
    remarks that the tale throws light on a passage in Ben Jonson:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Say we are robbed,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>If any come to borrow a spoon or
    so</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>I will not have Good Fortune or
    God's Blessing</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Let in, while I am
    busy.</span><br />

    <p>The earlier part of the tale has resemblance with "Lazy Jack" (No.
    xxvii), the European variants of which are given by M. Cosquin,
    <i>Contes de Lorraine</i>, i., 241. Jan's satisfaction with his wife's
    blunders is also European (Cosquin, <i>l.c.</i>, i., 157). On minding
    the door and dispersing robbers by its aid see "Mr. Vinegar" (No.
    vi.).</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;"Hereafterthis" is thus a
    <i>m&eacute;lange</i> of droll incidents, yet has characteristic
    folkish touches ("can you milk-y, bake-y," "when I lived home") which
    give it much vivacity.</p>

    <p>XLVI. THE GOLDEN BALL</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Contributed to the first edition of
    Henderson's <i>Folk-Lore of the Northern Counties</i>, pp. 333-5, by
    Rev. S. Baring-Gould.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Mr. Nutt gave a version in <i>Folk-Lore
    Journal</i>, vi., 144. The man in instalments occurs in "The Strange
    Visitor" (No. xxxii.). The latter part of the tale has been turned
    into a game for English children, "Mary Brown," given in Miss
    Plunket's <i>Merry Games</i>, but not included in Newell, <i>Games and
    Songs of American Children</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This story is especially interesting as
    having given rise to a game. Capture and imprisonment are frequently
    the gruesome <i>motif</i> of children's games, as in "Prisoner's
    base." Here it has been used with romantic effect.</p>
    <br />

    <p>XLVII. MY OWN SELF</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Told to Mrs. Balfour by Mrs. W., a native of
    North Sunderland, who had seen the cottage and heard the tale from
    persons who had known the widow and her boy, and had got the story
    direct from them. The title was "Me A'an Sel'," which I have altered
    to "My Own Self."</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Notwithstanding Mrs. Balfour's informant,
    the same tale is widely spread in the North Country. Hugh Miller
    relates it, in his <i>Scenes from my Childhood</i>, as "Ainsel"; it is
    given in Mr. Hartland's <i>English Folk and Fairy Tales</i>; Mr. F.B.
    Jevons has heard it in the neighbourhood of Durham; while a further
    version appeared in <i>Monthly Chronicle of North Country
    Folk-Lore</i>. Further parallels abroad are enumerated by Mr. Clouston
    in his <i>Book of Noodles</i>, pp. 184-5, and by the late Prof.
    K&ouml;hler in <i>Orient und Occident</i>, ii., 331. The expedient by
    which Ulysses outwits Polyphemus in the Odyssey by calling himself
    <span class="greek"
    title="outis">&omicron;&upsilon;&tau;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> is clearly
    of the same order.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The parallel with the Odyssey suggests the
    possibility that this is the ultimate source of the legend, as other
    parts of the epic have been adapted to local requirements in Great
    Britain, as in the "Blinded Giant" (No. lxi.), or "Conall Yellowclaw"
    (<i>Celtic Fairy Tales</i>, No. v.). The fact of Continental parallels
    disposes of the possibility of its being a merely local legend. The
    fairies might appear to be in a somewhat novel guise here as something
    to be afraid of. But this is the usual attitude of the folk towards
    the "Good People," as indeed their euphemistic name really
    implies.</p>
    <br />

    <p>XLVIII. THE BLACK BULL OF NORROWAY</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Chambers's <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i>,
    much Anglicised in language, but otherwise unaltered.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Chambers, <i>l.c.</i>, gave a variant with
    the title "The Red Bull o' Norroway." Kennedy, <i>Legendary
    Fictions</i>, p. 87, gives a variant with the title "The Brown Bear of
    Norway." Mr. Stewart gave a Leitrim version, in which "Norroway"
    becomes "Orange," in <i>Folk-Lore</i> for June, 1893, which Miss
    Peacock follows up with a Lincolnshire parallel (showing the same
    corruption of name) in the September number. A reference to the "Black
    Bull o' Norroway" occurs in Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, as also in the
    <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i>, 1548. The "sale of bed" incident at the
    end has been bibliographised by Miss Cox in her volume of variants of
    <i>Cinderella</i>, p. 481. It probably existed in one of the versions
    of <i>Nix Nought Nothing</i> (No. vii.).</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The Black Bull is clearly a Beast who
    ultimately wins a Beauty. But the tale as is told is clearly not
    sufficiently motivated. Miss Peacock's version renders it likely that
    a fuller account may yet be recovered in England.</p>
    <br />

    <p>XLIX. YALLERY BROWN</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Balfour's "Legends of the Lincolnshire
    Fens," in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, ii. It was told to Mrs. Balfour by a
    labourer, who professed to be the hero of the story, and related it in
    the first person. I have given him a name, and changed the narration
    into the oblique narration, and toned down the dialect.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;"Tiddy Mun," the hero of another of Mrs.
    Balfour's legends (<i>l.c.</i>, p. 151) was "none bigger 'n a three
    years old bairn," and had no proper name.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;One might almost suspect Mrs. Balfour of
    being the victim of a piece of invention on the part of her
    autobiographical informant. But the scrap of verse, especially in its
    original dialect, has such a folkish ring that it is probable he was
    only adapting a local legend to his own circumstances.</p>
    <br />

    <p>L. THE THREE FEATHERS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Collected by Mrs. Gomme from some hop-pickers
    near Deptford.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The beginning is <i>&agrave; la</i> Cupid
    and Psyche, on which Mr. Lang's monograph in the Carabas series is the
    classic authority. The remainder is an Eastern tale, the
    peregrinations of which have been studied by Mr. Clouston in his
    <i>Pop. Tales and Fictions</i>, ii., 289, <i>seq.</i> <i>The Wright's
    Chaste Wife</i> is the English <i>fabliau</i> on the subject. M.
    B&eacute;dier, in his recent work on <i>Les Fabliaux</i>, pp. 411-13,
    denies the Eastern origin of the <i>fabliau</i>, but in his
    Indiaphobia M. B&eacute;dier is <i>capable de tout</i>. In the Indian
    version the various messengers are sent by the king to test the
    chastity of a peerless wife of whom he has heard. The incident occurs
    in some versions of the "Battle of the Birds" story (<i>Celtic Fairy
    Tales</i>, No. xxiv.), and considering the wide spread of this in the
    British Isles, it was possibly from this source that it came to
    Deptford.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LI. SIR GAMMER VANS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Halliwell's <i>Nursery Rhymes and
    Tales.</i></p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;There is a Yorkshire Lying Tale in
    Henderson's <i>Folk-Lore</i>, first edition, p. 337, a Suffolk one,
    "Happy Borz'l," in <i>Suffolk Notes and Queries</i>, while a similar
    jingle of inconsequent absurdities, commencing "So he died, and she
    unluckily married the barber, and a great bear coming up the street
    popped his head into the window, saying, 'Do you sell any soap'?" is
    said to have been invented by Charles James Fox to test Sheridan's
    memory, who repeated it after one hearing. (Others attribute it to
    Foote.) Similar <i>Lugenm&auml;rchen</i> are given by the Grimms, and
    discussed by them in their Notes, Mrs. Hunt's translation, ii., pp.
    424, 435, 442, 450, 452, <i>cf.</i> Crane, <i>Ital. Pop. Tales</i>, p.
    263.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The reference to venison warrants, and bows
    and arrows seems to argue considerable antiquity for this piece of
    nonsense. The honorific prefix "Sir" may in that case refer to clerkly
    qualities rather than to knighthood.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LII. TOM HICKATHRIFT</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;From the Chap-book, <i>c.</i> 1660, in the
    Pepysian Library, edited for the Villon Society by Mr. G.L. Gomme. Mr.
    Nutt, who kindly abridged it for me, writes, "Nothing in the shape of
    incident has been omitted, and there has been no rewriting beyond a
    phrase here and there rendered necessary by the process of abridgment.
    But I have in one case altered the sequence of events putting the
    fight with the giant last."</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;There are similar adventures of giants in
    Hunt's Cornish <i>Drolls</i>. Sir Francis Palgrave (<i>Quart.
    Rev.</i>, vol. xxi.), and after him, Mr. Gomme, have drawn attention
    to certain similarities with the Grettir Saga, but they do not extend
    beyond general resemblances of great strength. Mr. Gomme, however,
    adds that the cartwheel "plays a not unimportant part in English
    folk-lore as a representative of old runic faith" (Villon Soc.
    edition, p. xv.).</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Mr. Gomme, in his interesting Introduction,
    points out several indications of considerable antiquity for the
    legend, various expressions in the Pepysian Chap-book ("in the marsh
    of the Isle of Ely," "good ground"), indicating that it could trace
    back to the sixteenth century. On the other hand, there is evidence of
    local tradition persisting from that time onward till the present day
    (Weaver, <i>Funerall Monuments</i>, 1631, pp. 866-7; Spelman,
    <i>Icenia</i>, 1640, p. 138; Dugdale, <i>Imbanking</i>, 1662 (ed.
    1772, p. 244); Blomefield, <i>Norfolk</i>, 1808, ix., pp. 79, 80).
    These refer to a sepulchral monument in Tylney churchyard which had
    figured on a stone coffin an axle-tree and cart-wheel. The name in
    these versions of the legend is given as Hickifric, and he is there
    represented as a village Hampden who withstood the tyranny of the
    local lord of the manor. Mr. Gomme is inclined to believe, I
    understand him, that there is a certain amount of evidence for Tom
    Hickathrift being a historic personality round whom some of the
    Scandinavian mythical exploits have gathered. I must refer to his
    admirable Introduction for the ingenious line of reasoning on which he
    bases these conclusions. Under any circumstances no English child's
    library of folk-tales can be considered complete that does not present
    a version of Mr. Hickathrift's exploits.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LIII. THE HEDLEY KOW</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Told to Mrs. Balfour by Mrs. M. of S.
    Northumberland. Mrs. M.'s mother told the tale as having happened to a
    person she had known when young: she had herself seen the Hedley Kow
    twice, once as a donkey and once as a wisp of straw. "Kow" must not be
    confounded with the more prosaic animal with a "C."</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;There is a short reference to the Hedley
    Kow in Henderson, <i>l.c.</i>, first edition, pp. 234-5. Our story is
    shortly referred to thus: "He would present himself to some old dame
    gathering sticks, in the form of a truss of straw, which she would be
    sure to take up and carry away. Then it would become so heavy that she
    would have to lay her burden down, on which the straw would become
    'quick,' rise upright and shuffle away before her, till at last it
    vanished from her sight with a laugh and shout." Some of Robin
    Goodfellow's pranks are similar to those of the Hedley Kow. The old
    woman's content with the changes is similar to that of "Mr. Vinegar."
    An ascending scale of changes has been studied by Prof. Crane,
    <i>Italian Popular Tales</i>, p. 373.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LIV. GOBBORN SEER</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Collected by Mrs. Gomme from an old woman at
    Deptford. It is to be remarked that "Gobborn Seer" is Irish (Goban
    Saor = free carpenter), and is the Irish equivalent of Wayland Smith,
    and occurs in several place names in Ireland.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The essence of the tale occurs in Kennedy,
    <i>l.c.</i>, p. 67, <i>seq.</i> Gobborn Seer's daughter was clearly
    the clever lass who is found in all parts of the Indo-European world.
    An instance in my <i>Indian Fairy Tales</i>, "Why the Fish Laughed"
    (No. xxiv.). She has been made a special study by Prof. Child,
    <i>English and Scotch Ballads</i>, i., 485, while an elaborate
    monograph by Prof. Benfey under the title "Die Kluge Dirne" (reprinted
    in his <i>Kleine Schriften</i>, ii., 156, <i>seq.</i>), formed the
    occasion for his first presentation of his now well-known hypothesis
    of the derivation of all folk-tales from India.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;But for the accident of the title being
    preserved there would have been nothing to show that this tale had
    been imported into England from Ireland, whither it had probably been
    carried all the way from India.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LV. LAWKAMERCYME</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Halliwell, <i>Nursery Rhymes</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;It is possible that this is an Eastern
    "sell": it occurs at any rate as the first episode in Fitzgerald's
    translation of Jami's <i>Sal&aacute;m&aacute;n and Abs&aacute;l</i>.
    Jami, <i>ob.</i> 1492, introduces the story to illustrate the
    perplexities of the problem of individuality in a pantheistic
    system.</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Lest, like the simple Arab in the
    tale,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>I grow perplext, O God! 'twixt ME
    and THEE,</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>If I&mdash;this Spirit that
    inspires me whence?</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>If THOU&mdash;then what this
    sensual impotence?</span><br />

    <p>In other words, M. Bourget's <i>Cruelle Enigme</i>. The Arab yokel
    coming to Bagdad is fearful of losing his identity, and ties a pumpkin
    to his leg before going to sleep. His companion transfers it to his
    own leg. The yokel awaking is perplexed like the pantheist.</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>If I&mdash;the pumpkin why on
    YOU?</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>If YOU&mdash;then where am I, and
    WHO?</span><br />
     <br />

    <p>LVI. TATTERCOATS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Told to Mrs. Balfour by a little girl named
    Sally Brown, when she lived in the Cars in Lincolnshire. Sally had got
    it from her mother, who worked for Mrs. Balfour. It was originally
    told in dialect, which Mrs. Balfour has omitted.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Miss Cox has included "Tattercoats" in her
    exhaustive collection of parallels of <i>Cinderella</i> (Folk-Lore
    Society Publications, 1892), No. 274 from the MS. which I had lent
    her. Miss Cox rightly classes it as "Indeterminate," and it has only
    the <i>Menial Heroine</i> and <i>Happy Marriage</i> episodes in common
    with stories of the Cinderella type.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Tattercoats</i> is of interest chiefly as
    being without any "fairy" or supernatural elements, unless the magic
    pipe can be so considered; it certainly gives the tale a fairy-like
    element. It is practically a prose variant of <i>King Cophetua and the
    Beggar Maid</i>, and is thus an instance of the folk-novel pure and
    simple, without any admixture of those unnatural incidents which
    transform the folk-novel into the serious folk-tale as we are
    accustomed to have it. Which is the prior, folk-novel or tale, it
    would be hard to say.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LVII. THE WEE BANNOCK</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Chambers's <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i>.
    I have attempted an impossibility, I fear, in trying to anglicise, but
    the fun of the original tempted me. There still remain several
    technical trade terms requiring elucidation. I owe the following to
    the kindness of the Rev. Mr. Todd Martin, of Belfast. <i>Lawtrod</i> =
    lap board on which the tailor irons; <i>tow cards</i>, the comb with
    which tow is carded; the <i>clove</i>, a heavy wooden knife for
    breaking up the flax. <i>Heckling</i> is combing it with a
    <i>heckle</i> or wooden comb; <i>binnings</i> are halters for cattle
    made of <i>sprit</i> or rushes. <i>Spurtle</i> = spoon; <i>whins</i> =
    gorse.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;This is clearly a variant of
    <i>Johnny-cake</i> = journey-cake, No. xxviii., where see Notes.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;But here the interest is with the pursuers
    rather than with the pursued. The subtle characterisation of the
    various occupations reaches a high level of artistic merit. Mr. Barrie
    himself could scarcely have succeeded better in a very difficult
    task.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LVIII. JOHNNY GLOKE</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Contributed by Mr. W. Gregor to <i>Folk-Lore
    Journal</i>, vii. I have rechristened "Johnny Glaik" for the sake of
    the rhyme, and anglicised the few Scotticisms.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;This is clearly <i>The Valiant Tailor</i>
    of the Grimms: "<i>x</i> at a blow" has been bibliographised. (See my
    List of Incidents in Trans. Folk-Lore Congress, 1892, <i>sub
    voce.</i>)</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;How <i>The Valiant Tailor</i> got to Aberdeen
    one cannot tell, though the resemblance is close enough to suggest a
    direct "lifting" from some English version of Grimm's <i>Goblins</i>.
    At the same time it must be remembered that <i>Jack the Giant
    Killer</i> (see Notes on No. xix.) contains some of the incidents of
    <i>The Valiant Tailor</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LIX. COAT O CLAY</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Contributed by Mrs. Balfour originally to
    <i>Longman's Magazine</i>, and thence to <i>Folk-Lore</i>, Sept.,
    1890.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;A rustic apologue, which is scarcely more
    than a prolonged pun on "Coat o' Clay." Mrs. Balfour's telling redeems
    it from the usual dulness of folk-tales with a moral or a double
    meaning.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LX. THE THREE COWS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Contributed to Henderson, <i>l.c.</i>, pp.
    321-2, by the Rev. S. Baring-Gould.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The incident "Bones together" occurs in
    <i>Rushen Coatie</i> (<i>infra</i>, No. lxx.), and has been discussed
    by the Grimms, i., 399, and by Prof. K&ouml;hler, <i>Or. und Occ.</i>,
    ii., 680.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXI. THE BLINDED GIANT</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Henderson's <i>Folk-Lore of Northern
    Counties</i>. See also <i>Folk-Lore</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Polyphemus in the Odyssey and the Celtic
    parallels in <i>Celtic Fairy Tales</i>, No. v., "Conall Yellowclaw."
    The same incident occurs in one of Sindbad's voyages.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Here we have another instance of the
    localisation of a well-known myth. There can be little doubt that the
    version is ultimately to be traced back to the Odyssey. The one-eyed
    giant, the barred door, the escape through the blinded giant's legs in
    the skin of a slaughtered animal, are a series of incidents that could
    not have arisen independently and casually. Yet till lately the mill
    stood to prove if the narrator lied, and every circumstance of local
    particularity seemed to vouch for the autochthonous character of the
    myth. The incident is an instructive one, and I have therefore
    included it in this volume, though it is little more than an anecdote
    in its present shape.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXII. SCRAPEFOOT</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Collected by Mr. Batten from Mrs. H., who
    heard it from her mother over forty years ago.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;It is clearly a variant of Southey's
    <i>Three Bears</i> (No. xviii.).</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This remarkable variant raises the question
    whether Southey did anything more than transform Scrapefoot into his
    naughty old woman, who in her turn has been transformed by popular
    tradition into the naughty girl Silver-hair. Mr. Nutt ingeniously
    suggests that Southey heard the story told of an old vixen, and
    mistook the rustic name of a female fox for the metaphorical
    application to women of fox-like temper. Mrs. H.'s version to my mind
    has all the marks of priority. It is throughout an animal tale, the
    touch at the end of the shaking the paws and the name Scrapefoot are
    too <i>volkst&uuml;mlich</i> to have been conscious variations on
    Southey's tale. In introducing the story in his <i>Doctor</i>, the
    poet laureate did not claim to do more than repeat a popular tale. I
    think that there can be little doubt that in Mrs. H.'s version we have
    now recovered this in its original form. If this is so, we may here
    have one more incident of the great Northern beast epic of bear and
    fox, on which Prof. Krohn has written an instructive monograph,
    <i>B&auml;r (Wolf.) und Fuchs</i> (Helsingfors, 1889).</p>

    <p>LXIII. THE PEDLAR OF SWAFFHAM</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;<i>Diary of Abraham de la Pryme</i> (Surtees
    Soc.) under date 10th November, 1699, but rewritten by Mr. Nutt, who
    has retained the few characteristic seventeenth century touches of
    Pryme's dull and colourless narration. There is a somewhat fuller
    account in Blomefield's <i>History of Norfolk</i>, vi., 211-13, from
    Twysden's <i>Reminiscences</i>, ed. Hearne, p. 299, in this there is a
    double treasure; the first in an iron pot with a Latin inscription,
    which the pedlar, whose name is John Chapman, does not understand.
    Inquiring its meaning from a learned friend, he is told&mdash;</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Under me doth lie</span><br />
     <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Another much richer than
    I.</span><br />

    <p>He accordingly digs deeper and finds another pot of gold.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Blomefield refers to Fungerus,
    <i>Etymologicum Latino-Gr&aelig;cum</i>, pp. 1110-11, where the same
    story is told of a peasant of Dort, in Holland, who was similarly
    directed to go to Kempen Bridge. Prof. E.B. Cowell, who gives the
    passage from Fungerus in a special paper on the subject in the
    <i>Journal of Philology</i>, vi., 189-95, points out that the same
    story occurs in the <i>Masn&aacute;vi</i> of the Persian port
    Jalaluddin, whose <i>floruit</i> is 1260 A.D. Here a young spendthrift
    of Bagdad is warned in a dream to repair to Cairo, with the usual
    result of being referred back.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The artificial character of the incident is
    sufficient to prevent its having occurred in reality or to more than
    one inventive imagination. It must therefore have been brought to
    Europe from the East and adapted to local conditions at Dort and
    Swaffham. Prof. Cowell suggests that it was possibly adapted at the
    latter place to account for the effigy of the pedlar and his dog.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXIV. THE OLD WITCH</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Collected by Mrs. Gomme at Deptford.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;I have a dim memory of hearing a similar
    tale in Australia in 1860. It is clearly parallel with the Grimms'
    <i>Frau Holle</i>, where the good girl is rewarded and the bad
    punished in a similar way. Perrault's <i>Toads and Diamonds</i> is of
    the same <i>genus</i>.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXV. THE THREE WISHES</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Steinberg's <i>Folk-Lore of
    Northamptonshire</i>, 1851, but entirely rewritten by Mr. Nutt, who
    has introduced from other variants one touch at the close&mdash;viz.,
    the readiness of the wife to allow her husband to remain
    disfigured.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Perrault's <i>Trois Souhaits</i> is the
    same tale, and Mr. Lang has shown in his edition of Perrault (pp.
    xlii.-li.) how widely spread is the theme throughout the climes and
    the ages. I do not, however, understand him to grant that they are all
    derived from one source&mdash;that represented in the Indian
    <i>Pantschatantra</i>. In my <i>&AElig;sop</i>, i., 140-1, I have
    pointed out an earlier version in Ph&aelig;drus where it occurs (as in
    the prose versions) as the fable of <i>Mercury and the two Women</i>,
    one of whom wishes to see her babe when it has a beard; the other,
    that everything she touches which she would find useful in her
    profession, may follow her. The babe becomes bearded, and the other
    woman raising her hand to wipe her eyes finds her nose following her
    hand&mdash;<i>d&eacute;nouement</i> on which the scene closes. M.
    B&eacute;dier, as usual, denies the Indian origin, <i>Les
    Fabliaux</i>, pp. 177, <i>seq.</i></p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;I have endeavoured to show, <i>l.c.</i>, that
    the Ph&aelig;drine form is ultimately to be derived from India, and
    there can be little doubt that all the other variants, which are only
    variations on one idea, and that an absurdly incongruous one, were
    derived from India in the last resort. The case is strongest for
    drolls of this kind.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXVI. THE BURIED MOON</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Balfour's "Legends of the Lincolnshire
    Cars" in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, ii., somewhat abridged and the dialect
    removed. The story was derived from a little girl named Bratton, who
    declared she had heard it from her "grannie." Mrs. Balfour thinks the
    girl's own weird imagination had much to do with framing the
    details.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The tale is noteworthy as being distinctly
    mythical in character, and yet collected within the last ten years
    from one of the English peasantry. The conception of the moon as a
    beneficent being, the natural enemy of the bogles and other dwellers
    of the dark, is natural enough, but scarcely occurs, so far as I
    recollect, in other mythological systems. There is, at any rate,
    nothing analogous in the Grimms' treatment of the moon in their
    <i>Teutonic Mythology</i>, tr. Stallybrass, pp. 701-21.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXVII. A SON OF ADAM</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;From memory, by Mr. E. Sidney Hartland, as
    heard by him from his nurse in childhood.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Jacques de Vitry <i>Exempla</i>, ed. Prof.
    Crane, No. xiii., and references given in notes, p. 139. It occurs in
    Swift and in modern Italian folk-lore.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The <i>Exempla</i> were anecdotes, witty and
    otherwise, used by the monks in their sermons to season their
    discourse. Often they must have been derived from the folk of the
    period, and at first sight it might seem that we had found still
    extant among the folk the story that had been the original of Jacques
    de Vitry's <i>Exemplum</i>. But the theological basis of the story
    shows clearly that it was originally a monkish invention and came
    thence among the folk.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXVIII. THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Percy, <i>Reliques</i>. The ballad form of the
    story has become such a nursery classic that I had not the heart to
    "prose" it. As Mr. Allingham remarks, it is the best of the ballads of
    the pedestrian order.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The second of R. Yarrington's <i>Two
    Lamentable Tragedies</i>, 1601, has the same plot as the ballad.
    Several chap-books have been made out of it, some of them enumerated
    by Halliwell's <i>Popular Histories</i> (Percy Soc.) No. 18. From one
    of these I am in the fortunate position of giving the names of the
    <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of this domestic tragedy. Androgus was
    the wicked uncle, Pisaurus his brother who married Eugenia, and their
    children in the wood were Cassander and little Kate. The ruffians were
    appropriately named Rawbones and Woudkill. According to a writer in
    <i>3 Notes and Queries</i>, ix., 144, the traditional burial-place of
    the children is pointed out in Norfolk. The ballad was known before
    Percy, as it is mentioned in the <i>Spectator</i>, Nos. 80 and
    179.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks</i>.&mdash;The only "fairy" touch&mdash;but what a
    touch!&mdash;the pall of leaves collected by the robins.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXIX. THE HOBYAHS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;<i>American Folk-Lore Journal</i>, iii., 173,
    contributed by Mr. S.V. Proudfit as current in a family deriving from
    Perth.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;But for the assurance of the tale itself that
    Hobyahs are no more, Mr. Batten's portraits of them would have
    convinced me that they were the bogles or spirits of the comma
    bacillus. Mr. Proudfit remarks that the cry "Look me" was very
    impressive.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXX. A POTTLE O' BRAINS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Contributed by Mrs. Balfour to
    <i>Folk-Lore</i>, II.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The fool's wife is clearly related to the
    Clever Lass of "Gobborn Seer," where see Notes.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The fool is obviously of the same family as
    he of the "Coat o' Clay" (No. lix.) if he is not actually identical
    with him. His adventures might be regarded as a sequel to the former
    ones. The Noodle family is strongly represented in English folk-tales,
    which would seem to confirm Carlyle's celebrated statistical
    remark.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXI. THE KING OF ENGLAND</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Mr. F. Hindes Groome, <i>In Gypsy Tents</i>,
    told him by John Roberts, a Welsh gypsy, with a few slight changes and
    omission of passages insisting upon the gypsy origin of the three
    helpful brothers.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The king and his three sons are familiar
    figures in European <i>m&auml;rchen</i>. Slavonic parallels are
    enumerated by Leskien Brugman in their <i>Lithauische
    M&auml;rchen</i>, notes on No. 11, p. 542. The Sleeping Beauty is of
    course found in Perrault.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The tale is scarcely a good example for Mr.
    Hindes Groome's contention (in <i>Transactions Folk-Lore Congress</i>)
    for the diffusion of all folk-tales by means of gypsies as
    <i>colporteurs</i>. This is merely a matter of evidence, and of
    evidence there is singularly little, though it is indeed curious that
    one of Campbell's best equipped informants should turn out to be a
    gypsy. Even this fact, however, is not too well substantiated.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXII. KING JOHN AND THE ABBOT</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;"Prosed" from the well-known ballad in Percy.
    I have changed the first query: What am I worth? Answer: Twenty-nine
    pence&mdash;one less, I ween, than the Lord. This would have sounded
    somewhat bold in prose.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Vincent of Beauvais has the story, but the
    English version comes from the German Joe Miller, Pauli's <i>Schimpf
    und Ernst</i>, No. lv., p. 46, ed. Oesterley, where see his notes. The
    question I have omitted exists there, and cannot have "independently
    arisen." Pauli was a fifteenth century worthy or unworthy.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Riddles were once on a time serious things to
    meddle with, as witness Samson and the Sphynx, and other instances
    duly noted with his customary erudition by Prof. Child in his comments
    on the ballad, <i>English and Scotch Ballads</i>, i, 403-14.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXIII. RUSHEN COATIE</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;I have concocted this English, or rather
    Scotch, Cinderella from the various versions given in Miss Cox's
    remarkable collection of 345 variants of <i>Cinderella</i> (Folk-Lore
    Society, 1892); see <i>Parallels</i> for an enumeration of those
    occurring in the British Isles. I have used Nos. 1-3, 8-10. I give my
    composite the title "Rushen Coatie," to differentiate it from any of
    the Scotch variants, and for the purposes of a folk-lore experiment.
    If this book becomes generally used among English-speaking peoples, it
    may possibly re-introduce this and other tales among the folk. We
    should be able to trace this re-introduction by the variation in
    titles. I have done the same with "Nix Nought Nothing," "Molly
    Whuppie," and "Johnny Gloke."</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Miss Cox's volume gives no less than 113
    variants of the pure type of Cinderella&mdash;her type A. "Cinderella,
    or the Fortunate Marriage of a Despised Scullery-maid by Aid of an
    <i>Animal</i> God-mother through the Test of a Slipper"&mdash;such
    might be the explanatory title of a chap-book dealing with the pure
    type of Cinderella. This is represented in Miss Cox's book, so far as
    the British Isles are concerned, by no less than seven variants, as
    follows: (1) Dr. Blind, in <i>Arch&aelig;ological Review</i>, iii.,
    24-7, "Ashpitell" (from neighbourhood of Glasgow). (2) A. Lang, in
    <i>Revue Celtique</i>, t. iii., reprinted in <i>Folk-Lore</i>,
    September, 1890, "Rashin Coatie" (from Morayshire). (3) Mr. Gregor, in
    <i>Folk-Lore Journal</i>, ii., 72-4 (from Aberdeenshire), "The Red
    Calf"&mdash;all these in Lowland Scots. (4) Campbell, <i>Popular
    Tales</i>, No. xliii., ii., 286 <i>seq.</i>, "The Sharp Grey Sheep."
    (5) Mr. Sinclair, in <i>Celtic Mag.</i>, xiii., 454-65, "Snow-white
    Maiden." (6) Mr. Macleod's variant communicated through Mr. Nutt to
    Miss Cox's volume, p. 533; and (7) Curtin, <i>Myths of Ireland</i>,
    pp. 78-92. "Fair, Brown, and Trembling"&mdash;these four in Gaelic,
    the last in Erse. To these I would add (8, 9) Chambers's two versions
    in <i>Pop. Rhymes of Scotland</i>, pp. 66-8, "Rashie Coat," though
    Miss Cox assimilates them to Type B. Catskin; and (10) a variant of
    Dr. Blind's version, unknown to Miss Cox, but given in 7 <i>Notes and
    Queries</i>, x., 463 (Dumbartonshire). Mr. Clouston has remarks on the
    raven as omen-bird in his notes to Mrs. Saxby's <i>Birds of Omen in
    Shetland</i> (privately printed, 1893).</p>

    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;In going over these various versions, the

    substantial agreement of the variants in each <i>language</i>. The
    English&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Scotch, variants go together; the Gaelic
    ones agree to differ from the English. I can best display this
    important agreement and difference by the accompanying two tables,
    which give, in parallel columns, Miss Cox's abstracts of her
    tabulations, in which each incident is shortly given in technical
    phraseology. It is practically impossible to use the long tabulations

    <p>Now, in the "English" versions there is practical unanimity in the
    concluding portions of the tale. <i>Magic dresses&mdash;Meeting-place
    (Church)&mdash;Flight&mdash;Lost Shoe&mdash;Shoe
    Marriage-test&mdash;Mutilated foot&mdash;False Bride&mdash;Bird
    witness&mdash;Happy Marriage</i>, follow one another with exemplary
    regularity in all four (six) versions.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"
    name='FNanchor_2_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_2_2'><sup>[2]</sup></a> The
    introductory incidents vary somewhat. Chambers has evidently a maimed
    version of the introduction of Catskin (see No. lxxxiii.). The
    remaining three enable us, however, to restore with some confidence
    the <i>Ur-</i>Cinderella in English somewhat as follows: <i>Helpful
    animal given by dying mother&mdash;Ill-treated heroine&mdash;Menial
    heroine&mdash;cornucopia&mdash;Spy on heroine&mdash;Slaying by helpful
    animal&mdash;Tasks&mdash;Revivified bones</i>. I have attempted in my
    version to reconstruct the "English" Cinderella according to these
    formul&aelig;. It will be observed that the helpful animal is helpful
    in two ways (a) in helping the heroine to perform tasks; (b) in
    providing her with magic dresses. It is the same with the Grimms'
    <i>Aschenputtel</i> and other Continental variants.</p>
    <p>Turning to the Celtic variants, these divide into two sets.
    Campbell's and Macleod's versions are practically at one with the
    English formula, the latter with an important variation which will
    concern us later. But the other two, Curtin's and Sinclair's, one
    collected in Ireland and the other in Scotland, both continue the
    formula with the conclusion of the Sea Maiden tale (on which see the
    Notes of my <i>Celtic Fairy Tales</i>, No. xvii.). This is a
    specifically Celtic formula, and would seem therefore to claim
    Cinderella for the Celts. But the welding of the Sea Maiden ending on
    to the Cinderella formula is clearly a later and inartistic junction,
    and implies rather imperfect assimilation of the Cinderella formula.
    To determine the question of origin we must turn to the purer type
    given by the other two Celtic versions.</p>
    <p>Campbell's tale can clearly lay no claim to represent the original
    type of Cinderella. The golden shoes are a gift of the hero to the
    heroine which destroys the whole point of the <i>Shoe marriage
    test</i>, and cannot have been in the original, wherever it
    originated. Mr. Macleod's version, however, contains an incident which
    seems to bring us nearer to the original form than any version
    contained in Miss Cox's book. Throughout the variants it will be
    observed what an important function is played by the helpful animal.
    This in some of the versions is left as a legacy by the heroine's
    dying mother. But in Mr. Macleod's version the helpful animal, a
    sheep, is the heroine's mother herself! This is indeed an archaic
    touch, which seems to hark back to primitive times and totemistic
    beliefs. And more important still, it is a touch which vitalises the
    other variants in which the helpful animal is rather dragged in by the
    horns. Mr. Nutt's lucky find at the last moment seems to throw more
    light on the origin of the tale than almost the whole of the remaining
    collection.</p>
    <p>But does this find necessarily prove an original Celtic origin for
    Cinderella? Scarcely. It remains to be proved that this introductory
    part of the story with helpful animal was necessarily part of the
    original. Having regard to the feudal character underlying the whole
    conception, it remains possible that the earlier part was ingeniously
    dovetailed on to the latter from some pre-existing and more archaic
    tale, perhaps that represented by the Grimms' <i>One Eyed, Two Eyes,
    and Three Eyes</i>. The possibility of the introduction of an archaic
    formula which had become a convention of folk-telling cannot be left
    out of account.</p>
    <p>The "Youngest-best" formula which occurs in Cinderella, and on
    which Mr. Lang laid much stress in his treatment of the subject in his
    "Perrault" as a survival of the old tenure of "junior right," does not
    throw much light on the subject. Mr. Ralston, in the <i>Nineteenth
    Century</i>, 1879, was equally unenlightening with his sun-myths.</p>

    <p>LXXIV. KING O' CATS</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;I have taken a point here and a point there
    from the various English versions mentioned in the next section.</p>
    <p>I have expanded the names, so as to make a jingle from the Dildrum
    and Doldrum of Hartland.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Five variants of this quaint legend have
    been collected in England: (1) Halliwell, <i>Pop. Rhymes</i>, 167,
    "Molly Dixon"; (2) <i>Choice Notes&mdash;Folk-Lore</i>, p. 73, "Colman
    Grey"; (3) <i>Folk-Lore Journal</i>, ii., 22, "King o' the Cats"; (4)
    <i>Folk-Lore&mdash;England</i> (Gibbings), "Johnny Reed's Cat"; (5)
    Hartland and Wilkinson, <i>Lancashire Legends</i>, p. 13, "Dildrum
    Doldrum." Sir F. Palgrave gives a Danish parallel; <i>cf.</i>
    Halliwell, <i>l.c.</i></p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;An interesting example of the spread and
    development of a simple anecdote throughout England. Here again we can
    scarcely imagine more than a single origin for the tale which is, in
    its way, as weird and fantastic as E.A. Poe.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXV. TAMLANE</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;From Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i>, with touches
    from the other variants given by Prof. Child in his <i>Eng. and Scotch
    Ballads</i>, i., 335-58.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Prof. Child gives no less than nine
    versions in his masterly edition, <i>l.c.</i>, besides another
    fragment "Burd Ellen and Young Tamlane," i., 258. He parallels the
    marriage of Peleus and Thetis in Apollodorus III., xiii., 5, 6, which
    still persists in modern Greece as a Cretan ballad.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Prof. Child remarks that dipping into water
    or milk is necessary before transformation can take place, and gives
    examples, <i>l.c.</i>, 338, to which may be added that of Catskin (see
    Notes <i>infra</i>). He gives as the reason why the Elf-queen would
    have "ta'en out Tamlane's two grey eyne," so that henceforth he should
    not be able to see the fairies. Was it not rather that he should not
    henceforth see Burd Janet?&mdash;a subtle touch of jealousy. On
    dwelling in fairyland Mr. Hartland has a monograph in his <i>Science
    of Fairy Tales</i>, pp. 161-254.</p>

    <p>LXXVI. THE STARS IN THE SKY</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Mrs. Balfour's old nurse, now in New Zealand.
    The original is in broad Scots, which I have anglicised.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The tradition is widespread that at the
    foot of the rainbow treasure is to be found; <i>cf.</i> Mr. John
    Payne's "Sir Edward's Questing" in his <i>Songs of Life and
    Death</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;The "sell" at the end is scarcely after the
    manner of the folk, and various touches throughout indicate a
    transmission through minds tainted with culture and introspection.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXVII. NEWS!</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Bell's <i>Speaker</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Jacques de Vitry, <i>Exempla</i>, ed.
    Crane, No. ccv., a servant being asked the news by his master returned
    from a pilgrimage to Compostella, says the dog is lame, and goes on to
    explain: "While the dog was running near the mule, the mule kicked him
    and broke his own halter and ran through the house, scattering the
    fire with his hoofs, and burning down your house with your wife." It
    occurs even earlier in Alfonsi's <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>, No.
    xxx., at beginning of the twelfth century, among the <i>Fabliaux</i>,
    and in Bebel, <i>Werke</i>, iii., 71, whence probably it was
    reintroduced into England. See Prof. Crane's note <i>ad loc.</i></p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Almost all Alfonsi's <i>exempla</i> are from
    the East. It is characteristic that the German version finishes up
    with a loss of honour, the English climax being loss of fortune.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXVIII. PUDDOCK, MOUSIE, AND RATTON</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Kirkpatrick Sharpe's <i>Ballad Book</i>, 1824,
    slightly anglicised.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Mr. Bullen, in his <i>Lyrics from
    Elizabethan Song Books</i>, p. 202, gives a version, "The Marriage of
    the Frog and the Mouse," from T. Ravenscroft's <i>Melismata</i>, 1611.
    The nursery rhyme of the frog who would a-wooing go is clearly a
    variant of this, and has thus a sure pedigree of three hundred years;
    <i>cf.</i> "Frog husband" in my List of Incidents, or notes to "The
    Well of the World's End" (No. xli.).</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXIX. LITTLE BULL-CALF</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;<i>Gypsy Lore Journal</i>, iii., one of a
    number of tales told "In a Tent" to Mr. John Sampson. I have respelt
    and euphemised the bladder.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The Perseus and Andromeda incident is
    frequent in folk-tales; see my List of Incidents <i>sub voce</i>
    "Fight with Dragon." "Cheese squeezing," as a test of prowess, is also
    common, as in "Jack the Giant Killer" and elsewhere (K&ouml;hler,
    <i>Jahrbuch</i>, vii., 252).</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXX. THE WEE WEE MANNIE</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;From Mrs. Balfour's old nurse. I have again
    anglicised.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;This is one of the class of accumulative
    stories like <i>The Old Woman and her Pig</i> (No. iv.). The class is
    well represented in these isles.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXXI. HABETROT AND SCANTLIE MAB</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Henderson's <i>Folk-Lore of Northern
    Counties</i>, pp. 258-62 of Folk-Lore Society's edition. I have
    abridged and to some extent rewritten.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;This in its early part is a parallel to the
    <i>Tom Tit Tot</i>, which see. The latter part is more novel, and is
    best compared with the Grimms' <i>Spinners</i>.</p>
    <p><i>Remark.</i>&mdash;Henderson makes out of Habetrot a goddess of
    the spinning-wheel, but with very little authority as it seems to
    me.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXXII. OLD MOTHER WIGGLE WAGGLE</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;I have inserted into Halliwell's version one
    current in Mr. Batten's family, except that I have substituted
    "Wiggle-Waggle" for "Slipper-Slopper." The two versions supplement one
    another.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;This is a pure bit of animal satire, which
    might have come from a rural Jefferies with somewhat more of wit than
    the native writer.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXXIII. CATSKIN</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;From the chap-book reprinted in Halliwell I
    have introduced the demand for magic dresses from Chambers's <i>Rashie
    Coat</i>, into which it had clearly been interpolated from some
    version of Catskin.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Miss Cox's admirable volume of variants of
    <i>Cinderella</i> also contains seventy-three variants of
    <i>Catskin</i>, besides thirteen "indeterminate" ones which
    approximate to that type. Of these eighty-six, five exist in the
    British Isles, two chap-books given in Halliwell and in Dixon's
    <i>Songs of English Peasantry</i>, two by Campbell, Nos. xiv. and
    xiv<i>a</i>, "The King who Wished to Marry his Daughter," and one by
    Kennedy's <i>Fireside Stories</i>, "The Princess in the Catskins."
    Goldsmith knew the story by the name of "Catskin," as he refers to it
    in the <i>Vicar</i>. There is a fragment from Cornwall in
    <i>Folk-Lore</i>, i., App. p. 149.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;<i>Catskin, or the Wandering Gentlewomen</i>,
    now exists in English only in two chap-book ballads. But Chambers's
    first variant of <i>Rashie Coat</i> begins with the Catskin formula in
    a euphemised form. The full formula may be said to run in abbreviated
    form&mdash;<i>Death-bed promise&mdash;Deceased wife's resemblance
    marriage test&mdash;Unnatural father</i> (desiring to marry his own
    daughter)&mdash;<i>Helpful animal&mdash;Counter tasks&mdash;Magic
    dresses&mdash;Heroine flight&mdash;Heroine disguise&mdash;Menial
    heroine&mdash;Meeting-place&mdash;Token objects named&mdash;Threefold
    flight&mdash;Lovesick prince&mdash;Recognition ring&mdash;Happy
    marriage</i>. Of these the chap-book versions contain scarcely
    anything of the opening <i>motifs</i>. Yet they existed in England,
    for Miss Isabella Barclay, in a variant which Miss Cox has overlooked
    (<i>Folk-Lore</i>, i., <i>l.c.</i>), remembers having heard the
    Unnatural Father incident from a Cornish servant-girl. Campbell's two
    versions also contain the incident, from which one of them receives
    its name. One wonders in what form Mr. Burchell knew Catskin, for "he
    gave the [Primrose] children the Buck of Beverland,<a
    id="FNanchor_3_3" name='FNanchor_3_3'></a><a
    href='#Footnote_3_3'><sup>[3]</sup></a> with the history of Patient
    Grissel, the adventures of Catskin and the Fair Rosamond's Bower"
    (<i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>, 1766, c. vi.). Pity that "Goldy" did not
    tell the story himself, as he had probably heard it in Ireland, where
    Kennedy gives a poor version in his <i>Fireside Stories</i>.</p>
    <p>Yet, imperfect as the chap-book versions are, they yet retain not a
    few archaic touches. It is clear from them, at any rate, that the
    Heroine was at one time transformed into a Cat. For when the basin of
    water is thrown in her face she "shakes her ears" just as a cat would.
    Again, before putting on her magic dresses she bathes in a pellucid
    pool. Now, Professor Child has pointed out in his notes on Tamlane and
    elsewhere (<i>English and Scotch Ballads</i>, i., 338; ii., 505; iii.,
    505) that dipping into water or milk is necessary before
    transformation can take place. It is clear, therefore, that Catskin
    was originally transformed into an animal by the spirit of her mother,
    also transformed into an animal.</p>
    <p>If I understand Mr. Nutt rightly (<i>Folk-Lore</i>, iv, 135,
    <i>seq.</i>), he is inclined to think, from the evidence of the
    hero-tales which have the unsavoury <i>motif</i> of the Unnatural
    Father, that the original home of the story was England, where most of
    the hero-tales locate the incident. I would merely remark on this that
    there are only very slight traces of the story in these islands
    nowadays, while it abounds in Italy, which possesses one almost
    perfect version of the formula (Miss Cox, No. 142, from Sardinia).</p>
    <p>Mr. Newell, on the other hand (<i>American Folk-Lore Journal</i>,
    ii., 160), considers Catskin the earliest of the three types contained
    in Miss Cox's book, and considers that Cinderella was derived from
    this as a softening of the original. His chief reason appears to be
    the earlier appearance of Catskin in Straparola,<a id="FNanchor_4_4"
    name='FNanchor_4_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_4_4'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
    1550, a hundred years earlier than Cinderella in Basile, 1636. This
    appears to be a somewhat insufficient basis for such a conclusion. Nor
    is there, after all, so close a relation between the two types in
    their full development as to necessitate the derivation of one from
    the other.</p>

    <p>LXXXIV. STUPID'S CRIES</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;<i>Folk-Lore Record</i>, iii., 152-5, by the
    veteran Prof. Stephens. I have changed "dog and bitch" of original to
    "dog and cat," and euphemised the liver and lights.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Prof. Stephens gives parallels from
    Denmark. Germany (the Grimms' <i>Up Riesensohn</i>) and Ireland
    (Kennedy, <i>Fireside Stories</i>, p. 30).</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXXV. THE LAMBTON WORM</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;Henderson's <i>Folk-Lore of Northern
    Counties</i>, pp. 287-9, I have rewritten, as the original was rather
    high falutin'.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Worms or dragons form the subject of the
    whole of the eighth chapter of Henderson. "The Laidly Worm of
    Spindleston Heugh" (No. xxxiii.) also requires the milk of nine kye
    for its daily rations, and cow's milk is the ordinary provender of
    such kittle cattle (Grimms' <i>Teut. Myth.</i> 687), the mythological
    explanation being that cows = the clouds and the dragon = the storm.
    Jephtha vows are also frequent in folk-tales: Miss Cox gives many
    examples in her <i>Cinderella</i>, p. 511.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;Nine generations back from the last of the
    Lambtons, Henry Lambton, M.P., ob. 1761, reaches Sir John Lambton,
    Knight of Rhodes, and several instances of violent death occur in the
    interim. Dragons are possibly survivals into historic times of
    antedeluvian monsters, or reminiscences of classical legend (Perseus,
    etc.). Who shall say which is which, as Mr. Lang would observe.</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXXVI. WISE MEN OF GOTHAM</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;The chap-book contained in Mr. Hazlitt's
    <i>Shaksperian Jest Book</i>, vol. iii. I have selected the incidents
    and modernised the spelling; otherwise the droll remains as it was
    told in Elizabethan times.</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;Mr. Clouston's <i>Book of Noodles</i> is
    little else than a series of parallels to our droll. See my List of
    Incidents under the titles, "One cheese after another," "Hare
    postman," "Not counting self," "Drowning eels." In most cases Mr.
    Clouston quotes Eastern analogies.</p>
    <p><i>Remarks.</i>&mdash;All countries have their special crop of
    fools, Boeotians among the Greeks, the people of Hums among the
    Persians (how appropriate!), the Schildburgers in Germany, and so on.
    Gotham is the English representative, and as witticisms call to mind
    well-known wits, so Gotham has had heaped on its head all the
    stupidities of the Indo-European world. For there can be little doubt
    that these drolls have spread from East to West. This "Not counting
    self" is in the <i>Gooroo Paramastan</i>, the cheeses "one after
    another" in M. Rivi&egrave;re's collection of Kabyle tales, and so on.
    It is indeed curious how little originality there is among mankind in
    the matter of stupidity. Even such an inventive genius as the late Mr.
    Sothern had considerable difficulty in inventing a new "sell."</p>
    <br />

    <p>LXXXVII. PRINCESS OF CANTERBURY</p>
    <p><i>Source.</i>&mdash;I have inserted into the old chap-book version
    of the <i>Four Kings of Colchester, Canterbury</i>, &amp;c., an
    incident entitled by Halliwell "The Three Questions."</p>
    <p><i>Parallels.</i>&mdash;The "riddle bride wager" is a frequent
    incident of folk-tales (see my List of Incidents); the sleeping tabu
    of the latter part is not so common, though it occurs, <i>e.g.</i>, in
    the Grimms' <i>Twelve Princesses</i>, who wear out their shoes with
    dancing.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
